They show that Arendt provides new ways of contesting biopolitical threats to human plurality and the way biopolitics, along with sexism, racism and political theology target women’s reproductive agency. They also extend Arendt’s account of collective political action to include consideration of political hospitality, responsibility and story-telling as ways of countering the harms of biopower.The book offers an insightful account of the political ontology of Hannah Arendt and forms new dialogues between her and major 20th- and 21st-century thinkers including Foucault, Agamben, Nancy, Kristeva, Esposito, Derrida, Levinas and Cavarero.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Arendt’s philosophy of natality that engages both biopolitical and feminist theoriesTeases out the implications of Arendt’s work for the diagnosis and contestation of the biopolitics of reproduction, including its racist elementsExamines how Arendt’s philosophy of natality changes the meaning of political concepts including agency, freedom, power, community, democratic plurality, responsibility and political hospitality Engages with contemporary political issues, such as struggles for reproductive justice, to demonstrate biopolitics' continuing threat to democratic pluralismMobilises Arendt as a biopolitical theorist between Foucault and Agamben to take Foucauldian biopolitical analysis beyond its usual focus on medical sociology"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

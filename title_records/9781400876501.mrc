He repeatedly expressed distrust of the British government’s motives; for their part, the British chafed at Wilson’s idealism and despised his aloofness from the Allies. Sir William Wiseman played an extraordinary part as the behind- the-scenes liaison between the two major powers. Acting as a personal friend and confidant of Wilson’s adviser, Colonel House, Wiseman is credited with keeping animosities in check between America and Great Britain, and for helping to establish coalition diplomacy, which was new to the U.S. in 1917-1918, though within 25 years it became a permanent characteristic of American foreign policy. British-American Relations, 1917-1918 provides fascinating insights not only into Wiseman’s role but into the entire diplomacy of the Wilson period.Originally published in 1969.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

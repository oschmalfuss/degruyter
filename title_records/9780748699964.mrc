How do you incite a popular folk revival? Can a poet truly speak with the ‘voice of the people’? And what happens to the writer who rejects print culture in favour of becoming Anon.? The life and times of polymath, scholar, author and folk-hero, Hamish Henderson (1919-2002), poses, and helps us to answer, these questions. This book examines his life-long commitment to finding a form of artistic expression suitable for post-war Europe. Though Henderson is a major figure in Scottish cultural history, his reputation is largely maintained through anecdotes and radical folk songs. This study explores his ideas in their intellectual, cultural and political contexts. It describes how all of his works – in war poetry, song collection, folklore scholarship, folksong revivalism, literary translation, and vicious public debates – reflect this desire to see the artist fully reintegrated in society.Key Features Reclaims Hamish Henderson from the marginalia of Scottish literary history, repositioning him as an insightful and original theorist on the politics of cultureProvides a previously unexplored perspective on twentieth-century Scottish cultural history, examining the modern literary Renaissance and the popular folk revival on a single trajectorySituates Scottish literary and cultural debates in the broader context of intellectual and cultural developments in twentieth-century Europe and the USTackles the question of national identity in twentieth-century Scotland, scrutinising the efforts of various cultural figures to conflate or combine Romantic nationalism and Internationalist socialism "  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

To many others, academic colleagues and former students, she has continued to be just that through all the years since.Flora Roy is unique among Canadian academics. She shepherded her department through perilous times without compromising her standards or adjusting them to meet the noisy demands of fad or faction. The successes and devotion of her students are her continuing testimony.” — Clara Thomas, Canadian Woman Studies Building on the success of her first volume, Recollections of Waterloo College, Flora Roy’s Recollections of Waterloo Lutheran University 1960-1973 continues her personal and anecdotal history of Wilfrid Laurier University. This memoir picks up the story following the institutions transition from Waterloo College, a small college affiliated with the University of Western Ontario, to the independent Waterloo Lutheran University. Documenting student demonstrations and faculty unrest of the 1960s as well as the university’s evolution from a religious to a secular institution, this illustrated book will appeal not only to alumni but to those interested in the history of Kitchener-Waterloo and of postsecondary education in Ontario. The royalties from the sale of this book will be directed towards funding scholarships.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

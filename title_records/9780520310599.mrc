While some of the original ecosystems have been preserved, others have been reduced to tattered remnants. Rich and varied habitats, with their plants and animals, are gone forever, destroyed by the conversion of valley lands to agriculture, the damming of streams, the cutting of forests, the paving of meadows. Wild California makes a persuasive argument for identifying and protecting areas of unspoiled California before they disappear. This is a stunning photographic guide to the six major California regions--from the Sierra Nevada to the desert--and their wildlife. To A. Starker Leopold, conservationist, naturalist, wildlife biologist, and educator, the delicate balance between plants, animals, and humans in each community is precious and fragile. In a highly readable style that mingles authority and eloquence, Leopold reminds us of th aesthetic, educational, and scientific values of undeveloped land. Tupper Ansel Blake, naturalist and wildlife photographer, has contributed one hundred color images that marvelously convey the special beauties of this state. Fortunately, the rich legacy of early California can still be found, and Tupper Blake's images with Starker Leopold's words are powerful evidence that this wilderness is worth preserving for future generations.This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

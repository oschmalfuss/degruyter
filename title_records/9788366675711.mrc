The second edition of the Conference Proceedings will be also released on the Sciendo platform. The conference Business, Economics and Sustainability Science (BESS) brings together leading researchers and scientists from the domains of economics, business and the environmental sciences and here worldwide to formulate a green outline for crisis recovery. The combination of public and business policies with technological innovation could be a scenario to mitigate the negative impact of economic activities on sustainable development. Green recovery can address the climate crisis through encouraging all stakeholders to act environmentally responsibly. Green stimulus should be seen as a long-term response to the pandemic because it is a tool for reshaping the economy rather than simply restarting it. The topics of interest to be covered by BESS 2021 include, but are not limited to: Business in the context of sustainable development Business environment dynamics E-business and E-commerce, Sustainable entrepreneurship SMEs and entrepreneurship Ethical and environmental issues Human resources practices and organizational strategies Role of IT in sustainable development Green behavior Management for sustainability Green solutions, eco taxes, eco-labelling Sustainable future, policies, innovation, investment funds Economics in the context of sustainable development Environmental economics Sustainability of competitive advantage Economic sustainability Environmental economics and sustainable development finance Sustainable urban and rural development Smart city and environmental issues Local economic development Sustainable development Green circular economy Natural resource economics Environmental impact assessment Environment and sustainable development Development and sustainability management Sustainability science Education for sustainable development Sustainable tourism and ecotourism Ecology and sustainability Global environmental issues Green energy Environmental sustainability Socio cultural sustainability Sustainability accounting Sustainable future Sustainability transitions Campus design for sustainability Curriculum development for sustainability Sustainability in education Distance education, e-learning, blended learning, ICT in education Publication Policies 1.

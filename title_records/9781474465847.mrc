However, outside Scotland, the artist rarely makes more than a fleeting appearance in survey books about portraiture.Ten international scholars recover Raeburn from his artistic isolation by looking at his local and international reception and reputation, both in his lifetime and posthumously. It focuses as much on Edinburgh and Scotland as on metropolitan markets and cosmopolitan contexts. Previously unpublished archival material is brought to light for the first time, especially from the Innes of Stow papers and the archives of the dukes of Hamilton.Key Features 11 chapters each looking at different aspects of Raeburn's professional careerInternational scholars contributing to Raeburn studies for the first timeInterdisciplinary perspectives setting a new agenda for Raeburn studiesTraditional art analysis integrated with cultural, social, political and economic historyIncludes much unpublished archival material  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

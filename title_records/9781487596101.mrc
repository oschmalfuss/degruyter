But business in its turn must shoulder a greater share of the responsibility for supporting the university. The essays in this volume help to explore the relations and the mutual responsibilities of the university and business. Professor V. Bladen, Colonel W.E. Phillips, and Dean M. St.A. Woodside of the University of Toronto discuss the problem as Canadians see it; Sir Arnold Plant of London and Dean Stanley F. Teele of Harvard show the English and American attitudes. These essays were first published as a supplement to the University of Toronto Quarterly, but it was felt that as they made such a notable contribution to a problem which is bound to be debated with increasing interest for several years, they should be issued in a separate volume.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

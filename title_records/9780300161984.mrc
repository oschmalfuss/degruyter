In this provocative and disturbing book, Edith Wyschogrod shows that the various manifestations of man-made mass death form a single structure, a “death-event,” which radically alters our understanding of language, time, and self. She contends that the death event has its own logic and driving force that she traces to pre-Socratic philosophy and to certain mythological motifs that recur in Western thought.“Spirit in Ashes is one book in contemporary philosophy that should be read aloud and taken to heart by any professional or intellectual who purports to have a conscience.”-Carl Rasche, Journal of the American Academy of Religion“A masterful blend of scholarship, originality, and serious passion.”-Robert C. Neville, Commonweal“An original, insightful, and challenging work.”-Robert Burch, Canadian Philosophical Reviews  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

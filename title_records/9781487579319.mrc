The number of composers of serious music has grown remarkably, particularly in the last thirty-five years, and Canadian compositions are now performed worldwide. Yet listeners are not always familiar with the names or the music of composers such as Barbara Pentland, Claude Champagne, Serge Garant, and Harry Somers, in part because commentaries are rare and recordings and sources are often difficult to find. This book discusses, in historical sequence, selected works of approximately 125 representative composers, combining detailed descriptions of their works with valuable summaries of stylistic trends. Canadian musical activity is studied in relation to developments in the music of the Western world. In addition, influences from jazz, folk, and popular music, are identified, and there is a welcome attempt to integrate musical developments with those in literature, painting, and the arts in general. This book is the first practical guide to Canadian classical music of the twentieth century; it includes extensive lists of scores and recordings, arranged chronologically by performance medium. It is the best available introduction to modern Canadian music -- a book every listener will want to own.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

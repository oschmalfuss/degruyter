Regarded by Heine andothers as his best-written book, it was also his most disastrously conceived. Intended to recover the high ground of revolutionary principle and philosophy against the attacks mounted on him by Börne and his supporters, the bookwas instead met by a storm of outrage from which it seemed Heine's reputation might never recover. In the course of time, the evaluation was reversed; Heine was increasingly celebrated as a true herald of revolution. His vocabulary of Hellenism and Nazarenism, employed for the first time in Börne, was transmitted into English usage by Matthew Arnold. But Börne itself is Heine's only major work that has never been fully translated into English. The commentary to the edition clarifies the conflict between the two most prominent German-Jewish public intellectuals of their time, corrects the misapprehensions constantly in circulation about their relationship and the book,and reveals the many peculiarities of the text. Jeffrey L. Sammons is Leavenworth Professor of German Emeritus at Yale University and the author of four books on Heine.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

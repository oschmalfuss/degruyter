This influential book demonstrated that the movement - which held that Canada could only become a great nation within the British Empire - was significantly influenced by its leading advocates' belief in nationalism. Carl Berger explores the emotional appeal and intellectual context of this belief, arguing that these advocates' support of imperial unity can be grasped only in terms of their commitment to certain conservative values and in relation to their conception of Canada.The Sense of Power was commended by the Toronto Star when it was first published as "entertaining as well as brilliant," and in 2011 Ramsay Cook noted that "few first books, or for that matter few books, have made as marked an impact on the interpretation of a major theme in Canadian history." This second edition brings to life the work's incisive analysis and its important contribution to Canadian intellectual history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

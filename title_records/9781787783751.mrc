Drawing on more than 30 years of hands-on experience, he gives clear, practical and up-to-date advice on how to implement a QMS (Quality Management System) to maximum effect. In September 2015, the much-anticipated sixth version of ISO 9001 was published, and, with it, several myths were given life. Implementations of QMSs, based on the requirements of ISO 9001, have been plagued by misunderstood and misinterpreted requirements, from the earliest version back in 1987. New myths have arrived with the publication of the ISO 9001:2015 edition. This book exposes many of the myths and enables a better understanding of ISO 9001:2015 by those who seek to create, implement, and improve an effective QMS for their organization. Full of real-life examples, this book enables you to read and successfully interpret the ISO 9001:2015 documentation  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

The role of hero did not suit Triquet and weighed heavily on him and his family. MacFarlane shows how Triquet's story was changed by those who wished to make his hero status the cornerstone in a political debate between francophones and anglophones, particularly with regard to his representing the Commonwealth despite his French-Canadian heritage.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

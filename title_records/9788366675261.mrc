Kirițescu" National Institute for Economic Research (NIER) within the Romanian Academy is to present and evaluate the economic scientific research portfolio, to argue and substantiate the Romanian development strategies - including European and global best practices, to provide an opportunity for researches, practitioners, and academics interested in economic scientific research, both theoretical, practical and empirical discuss and exchange insightful research ideas. The 7th edition of the International Conferences "Economic Scientific Research-Theoretical, Empirical and Practical Approaches"- (ESPERA), under the title "30 Years of Inspiring Academic Economic Research - From the Transition to a Market Economy to the Interlinked Crises of 21st Century" was organized virtually during 26th -27th November 2020, In Bucharest, Romania. The event, dedicated to the 30th anniversary of NIER and its economic research network of its return under the auspices of the Romanian Academy, will include a scientific program of wide diversity initiatives, bringing together researchers from all NIER institutes and centers, members of the Romanian Academy, Romanian academic researchers and also guests from other countries. The ESPERA Conference is organized in such a way as to provide an academic platform for debates, covering the broadest approaches, enabling an interactive exchange of ideas on state-of-the art knowledge and the latest results and findings, including those emerged in economic science arising from both fundamental and empirical researches and promoting evidence-based policy making. Researchers are encouraged to present articles on economic scientific research that they have focused on most over the past 30 years, summarizing as much as possible paradigm shifts and dialogue between currents of thought, developments and trends in national, European and international economic realities. The recent developments in the world economy and the interlinked crises which are shaping up over the horizon of an increasingly uncertain future in this Century should also be essential reflection topics for challenges and opportunities trading-off. The main topics of the conference are focused on but not limited to the following sections: Assessment of economic-social and political experiences and thoughts; Business ethics - economic strength or weakness in a global world; Contributions to the New Encyclopedia of Romania; Demographic facts and figures; Development and improvement of economic and social forecasting tools; Economic instability and stabilization policies; Economy dynamics and structural changes for a competitive growth; European integration and globalization - new challenges; Food safety and security - challenges for agriculture economic development; Knowledge, innovation, smart development and human capital; Mountain Economy; Natural resources patrimony - costs and benefits of its valorization; PhD and post PhD students debates; Quality of life and social policies evaluations; Romania's sustainable economic and social development.

Kirițescu" National Institute for Economic Research (NIER), is to present and evaluate the economic scientific research portfolio, to argue and substantiate the Romanian development strategies - including European and global best practices. The 2020 edition of the Conference will be held on 26th -27th November, under the title: "30 Years of Inspiring Academic Economic Research - From the Transition to a Market Economy to the Interlinked Crises of 21st Century". The event, dedicated to the 30th anniversary of NIER and its economic research network of its return under the auspices of the Romanian Academy, will include a scientific program of wide diversity initiatives, bringing together researchers from all NIER institutes and centres, members of the Romanian Academy, Romanian academic researchers and also guests from other countries. Researchers are encouraged to present articles on economic scientific research that they have focused on most over the past 30 years, summarizing as much as possible paradigm shifts and dialogue between currents of thought, developments and trends in national, European and international economic realities. The recent developments in the world economy and the interlinked crises which are shaping up over the horizon of an increasingly uncertain future in this Century should also be essential reflection topics for challenges and opportunities trading-off. The Conference is organized in such a way as to provide an academic platform for debates, covering the broadest approaches, enabling an interactive exchange of ideas on state-of-the art knowledge and the latest results and findings, including those emerged in economic science arising from both fundamental and empirical researches and promoting evidence-based policy making.

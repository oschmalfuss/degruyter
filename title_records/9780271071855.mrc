Pokrovskii was born in Moscow in 1868. He described the years before 1905 as his time of ";democratic illusions and economic materialism."; His interest in legal Marxism began in the 1890's but it was only with the Revolution of 1905 that he stepped into the Marxist camp.Pokrovskii was a leader in the creation of the ";historical front";-an organization of scholars authorized to work out a Marxist theory of the past. He formalized the bond between scholarship and politics through his belief that historians should assist party authorities in effecting a cultural revolution; thus he supported Stalin's collectivization of agriculture and leg a campaign to silence non-Marxist scholars, some of whom he had defended earlier. Yet his accommodation with Stalin was uneasy, and after Pokrovskii's death in 1932 his allegedly ";abstract sociological schemes"; were condemned and his career was dubbed pokrovshcina-era of the wicked deeds of Pokrovskii.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 21.

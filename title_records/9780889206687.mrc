Central to his religious vision was his innovative and complex "mental philosophy," first sketched out at Oxford during his Anglican years and developed in its most detailed form in his celebrated Grammar of Assent. In The Mental Philosophy of John Henry Newman, Jay Newman (no relation) presents a careful scrutiny of John Henry Newman's phenomenology of belief and epistemology in the context of the nineteenth-century cleric's major work. He departs from traditional historical and technological approaches to Newman's work on belief and critically examines Newman's contribution in this area from the standpoint of contemporary analytical philosophy. The study examines the sources, aims, and implications of Newman's philosophical project. While it draws attention to the positive value of Newman's original approach, it also explores the weaknesses and dangers of Newman's main phenomenological and epistemological theories. Jay Newman not only makes a significant original contribution to the field of Newman studies but also provides us with a guide to some of the problems and confusions of the Grammar of Assent.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

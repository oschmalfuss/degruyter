He justifies his view that they are not 'mad' by tracing the histories of mental disorder, sexuality and Byronism, and by placing each opera within its cultural context. He also considers what professional treatment is needed according to modern criteria. His gallery of heroes includes the hubristic Otello and Godunov, the psychopathic Iago and Claggart, the schizoid Wozzeck and Grimes, the borderline Werther and Herman, the narcissistic Don Giovanni and Onegin, and the repressed and melancholic Faust and Aschenbach. Each is considered within the overall design of their respective work. Cordingly also probes the reception of each opera and draws comparisons with cases from life. The book is a landmark in being the first of its kind and weaves a fascinating tapestry of concerns. It is also eminently readable. JOHN CORDINGLY (author) is a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

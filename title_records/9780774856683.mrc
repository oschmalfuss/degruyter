Conversely, the popular interpretation of Tuum Est, 'It's up to you,' has held greater significance for women. Stewart examines the demands, accomplishments, and limitations of women advocates and educators against the background of the social and cultural conditions which enveloped them. \ The book profiles the experience of women at UBC from the founding of the university early inthis century until after the Second World War. Stewart argues that campaigns to open the university, to start nursing and home economic programs, to establish the office of dean of women, and to build women's residences each involved the persistent efforts of women reformers, and each eventually succeeded. At the same time, pragmatism, politics, and expedience, far more than a passion for feminism within the university or in the province, accounted for the form that these programs and institutions took. Stewart also describes the experience of female students and the strategies they devised to participate fully in the academic, cultural, and political life of the university. Young women had to juggle the contradictory expectations of the academic and social communities. In describing this process the author consciously links women's experience to the history of the university itself. Stewart makes an important contribution to our understanding of higher education and to the history of a major Canadian university. She also expands our sensitivity to women's changing role in the twentieth century.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

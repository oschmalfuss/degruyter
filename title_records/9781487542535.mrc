Leading for Equity and Social Justice provides a deep look at some of these inequities and injustices and offers transformative leadership as one way for leaders to stimulate, support, and foster equitable and socially just practices in educational institutions. This collection emphasizes the systemic nature of inequality and supports the necessity of systemic change to target not only individuals but also structures, policies, and far-reaching practices. Focusing on various marginalized groups – including the Indigenous community, LGBTQ2S+ peoples, refugees, newcomers, and specific groups of teachers – chapters explore transformative leadership in practice and how to achieve inclusion, respect, and excellence in schools. Arguing that leadership involves much more than simply putting policy into practice, Leading for Equity and Social Justice promotes the need for leaders to recognize their role as advocates and activists.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

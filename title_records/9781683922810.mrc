It follows a logical path, using the axioms or rules to understand structures such as groups, rings, and fields, and giving the reader examples to help, but leaving many theorems and examples for them to try. The unique feature of the text is the list of “projects” at the end of each chapter that can be used in the classroom (with students solving them), alone, or in groups with the aid of an instructor. Because of their interactive nature, the projects are designed to reinforce previous concepts.Features: A logic-based presentation, with the structures of groups, rings, and fields presented in similar ways through objects, sub-objects, mappings between objects, and "ients of objectsFollows a fairly straight path without many of the side areas, such as modules, in order to introduce Galois Theory and solvability of polynomialsProvides numerous examples, exercises, and the inclusion of “projects” in each chapterAdds more, varied examples to use when illustrating ideas such as order of elements, direct products, and subgroupsIncludes new material on the history of mathematics with vignettes of mathematicians Provides instructor’s resources with solutions and PowerPoint slides for use as a textbook  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

The Other Worker was prepared for publication while both men were senior specialists at the East-West Center in Honolulu. Both have published widely in their separate countries, both have been involved in exchange Fulbright programs, and both are in demand as management consultants.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

Yet, this field has been dominated by studies of the United States' soft power practices. However, the so-called 'cultural dimension' of the Cold war was a much more multifaceted phenomenon. Little attention has been paid to European actors' efforts to safeguard a wide range of strategic and political interests by seducing foreign publics. This book includes a series of works which examine the soft power techniques used by various European players to create a climate of public opinion overseas which favored their interests in the Cold war context. This is a relevant book for three reasons. First, it contains a wide variety of case studies, including Western and Eastern, democratic and authoritarian, and core and peripheral European countries. Second, it pays attention to little studied instruments of public diplomacy such as song contests, sport events, tourism and international solidarity campaigns. Third, it not only concentrates on public diplomacy programs deployed by governments, but also on the role played by some non-official actors in the cultural Cold War in Europe  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 21.

The author of Carajicomedia: Parody and Satire in Early Modern Spain believes that it is a sophisticated and complex composition that provides as good a vantage point from which to examine the ideology of the period as does La Celestina. In their poems, the writers of Carajicomedia inadvertently reveal thedeep worries of the knights and nobles who opposed the regencies of Ferdinand the Catholic and Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros pending the arrival of Charles V. Carajicomedia is therefore a harbinger of the War of the Comuneros, the great popular revolt that convulsed Spain in 1520. In this book's chapters, the author examines the parodic relationship between the text of Juan de Mena's El Laberinto de Fortuna, the glosses of Hernán Núñez's Las Trezientas, and Carajicomedia. He then turns to its actual writers and their settings, and shows how their satirical attitudes towards males, females, and conversos reveals the failure of the societal mechanisms in place to control desire and miscegenation. Carajicomedia: Parody and Satire in Early Modern Spain concludes with a paleographic edition of the text and appendices that contain a modern Spanish version and its Englishtranslation, as well as examine Carajicomedia's language. Frank A. Domínguez is a professor of medieval Spanish literature and culture at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

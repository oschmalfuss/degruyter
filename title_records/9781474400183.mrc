Winner of the Man Booker International Prize 2013, Davis writes innovative short stories that question the boundaries of the genre. She is also an important translator of French writers such as Maurice Blanchot, Michel Leiris, Marcel Proust and Gustave Flaubert. Translation and writing go hand-in-hand in Davis's work. Through a series of readings, this study investigates how Davis's translations and stories relate to each other, finding that they are inextricably interlinked. It explores how Davis uses translation - either as a compositional tool or a plot device - and other instances of rewriting in her stories, demonstrating that translation is central for understanding her prose. Understanding how Davis's work complicates divisions between translating and other forms of writing highlights the role of translation in literary production.Key FeaturesThe first monograph on this key contemporary writer that analyses texts from throughout her careerA series of analyses of Davis's major translations and how her work interacts with themA rethinking of the role of translation in literary production and the boundaries between translating and writing  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

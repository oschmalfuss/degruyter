Drawing on a wealth of previously unseen documents, sourced by Freedom of Information requests, together with interviews with government and intelligence agency officials, Louise Kettle questions whether the British government has learned anything from its military interventions in the Middle East. She provides an extended commentary on military interventions in the Middle East since the 1950s, including a behind-the-scenes glimpse into Whitehall decision-making and a critical examination of the 2016 Iraq Inquiry report.The result is a highly original account of key political events that challenges the claims of lessons being learned from recent wars. This book comes at a decisive moment as the ongoing war against Daesh, conflicts in Syria, and Saudi-Iran tensions continue to leave British action in the region as a contemporary reality where lessons from the past could prevent the British government from making the same mistakes again and again.Case Studies1956: Suez - Operation Musketeer1958: Jordan - Operation Fortitude1961: Kuwait - Operation Vantage1990-1: Gulf - Operation Granby2003-9: Iraq - Operation TelicKey FeaturesReveals the relationship between history and policy in No 10, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ministry of Defence and across the intelligence communityExposes the tensions between government departments over crucial foreign policy decisionsDraws on documents obtained through over 30 Freedom of Information requests, including reports from the Gulf and Iraq wars, documents from the Joint Intelligence Committee after Suez and Policy Planning documents from the Foreign and Commonwealth OfficeThe author conducted interviews with current and past officials from the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and the intelligence agencies, including diplomats, Ambassadors, research analysts, service personnel, members of the JIC, MoD lessons teams, official historians and witnesses to the Iraq Inquiry  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

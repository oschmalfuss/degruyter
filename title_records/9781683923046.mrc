Game programming is incorporated into the text in a way that does not compromise the amount of material traditionally covered in a basic programming course and permits instructors who are not familiar with game programming and computer graphics concepts to realize the verified pedagogical advantages of game applications. The companion disc includes a game environment that is easily integrated into projects created with the popular Java Development Environments, including Eclipse, NetBeans, and JCreator in a student-friendly way and also includes a set of executable student games to pique their interest by giving them a glimpse into their future capabilities. The material presented in the book is in full compliance with the 2013 ACM/IEEE computer science curriculum guidelines. It has been used to teach programming to students whose majors are within and outside of the computing fields. Ancillaries include a comprehensive instructor’s resource disc with programming solutions, slides, quizzes, projects, and more. FEATURES:* Uses an objects-early approach to learning Java* Follows the 2013 ACM/IEEE computer science curriculum guidelines* Integrates game applications as a central pedagogical tool to improve student engagement, learning outcomes, and retention* Includes a companion disc with projects created with the popular Java Development Environments; also includes a set of executable student games, source code, and figures* Uses working programs to illustrate concepts under discussion* Complete instructor’s resource package available upon adoption  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

By analysing animation production in Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, the Palestinian Territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates, this book seeks to demonstrate how rival notions of national, pan-Arab and Islamic identities have been advocated, challenged and fused by Arab animated cartoons.From the 1930s until the recent spread of online animations, animated cartoon production in the Arab world was the privilege of individuals and institutions with strong links to academic, media and political elites. These elites had maintained both direct and indirect authority over production in a number of ways, including funding, regulation and censorship. Arab animated films and series thus became a legitimate focus of well-defined cultural policies and, in many cases, even of political and religious agendas.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

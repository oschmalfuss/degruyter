Focusing on the material realities legible in manuscripts and Sammelbände, bookshops and private libraries, Eckhardt uncovers the myriad ways in which Donne's writings were received and presented, first by his contemporaries, and later by subsequent readers of his work.Eckhardt sheds light on the religious writings with which Donne's work was linked during its circulation, using a bibliographic approach that also informs our understanding of his work's reception during the early modern period. He analyzes the religious implications of the placement of Donne's poem "A Litany" in a library full of Roman Catholic and English prayer books, the relationship and physical proximity of Donne's writings to figures such as Sir Thomas Egerton and Izaak Walton, and the movements in later centuries of Donne's work from private owners to the major libraries that have made this study possible. Eckhardt's detailed research reveals how Donne's writings have circulated throughout history-and how religious readers, communities, and movements affected the distribution and reception of his body of work.Centered on a place in time when distinct methods of reproduction, preservation, and circulation were used to negotiate a complex and sometimes dangerous world of confessional division, Religion Around John Donne makes an original contribution to Donne studies, religious history, book history, and reception studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 21.

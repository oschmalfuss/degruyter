They show that we need to bring the rules of war into alignment with increasingly digital means of conducting kinetic warfare through the force short of war paradigm.The use of force short of war is now commonplace, in large part owing to casualty averseness and the explosion of emerging technologies, most notably drones, autonomous robotics and cyberwarfare. It often involves the selective or limited use of military force to achieve political objectives and assumes many forms. These include targeted killing, assassination, special-forces raids, limited duration bombing campaigns or missile strikes, and 'low intensity' counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations.Key FeaturesInvestigates innovative normative methods for aligning modern conflict with contemporary ethical and legal expectationsPresents a new way to understand and potentially reconcile a centuries-old theoretical dispute between classical and revisionist accounts of just warProvides a means of better governing the use of emerging military technologies that have plagued governments in recent timesOpens new avenues for thinking about the ethics of robotic, cyber and other novel military technologies in the context of military and political decision-makingContributorsEamon Aloyo, Lecturer at Leiden University and Senior Researcher at The Hague Institute of Global Justice.Christian Braun, Research Fellow in Philosophy at Durham Univeristy.Megan Braun, a Rhodes Scholar pursuing International Relations at Oxford University.Daniel Brunstetter, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Irvine.Helen Frowe, Professor of Practical Philosophy and Director of the Stockholm Centre for the Ethics of War and Peace.

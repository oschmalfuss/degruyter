Analyzing the processes by which commercial media are organized, Streeter asks how it is possible to take the practice of broadcasting-the reproduction of disembodied sounds and pictures for dissemination to vast unseen audiences-and constitute it as something that can be bought, owned, and sold. With an impressive command of broadcast history, as well as critical and cultural studies of the media, Streeter shows that liberal marketplace principles-ideas of individuality, property, public interest, and markets-have come into contradiction with themselves. Commercial broadcasting is dependent on government privileges, and Streeter provides a searching critique of the political choices of corporate liberalism that shape our landscape of cultural property and electronic intangibles.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

[The diary of John Harvey, later MP for Bedfordshire, on his Grand tour in France, Switzerland and Italy.] ‘Edmond and Christian Williamson of Husborne Crawley, 1709-20’, edited by F. J. Manning. [Two pages of notes recording the births of their eight children and the deaths of four and of their mother Christian.]‘Henry Taylor of Pulloxhill, 1750-72’, edited by Patricia Bell. [An account, called ‘Remarks on Brother’s proceedings … a concise and true account’, by George Chalkley Taylor of the life of his brother made in connection with lawsuits between them. They were brought up as Quakers. Henry Taylor was probably a miller in Luton in the 1750s.]‘John Salusbury of Leighton Buzzard, 1757-9’, edited by Joyce Godber. [John Salusbury was a small landowner, local charity trustee, turnpike trustee, militia officer, tax commissioner and a justice of the peace. The diary recounts his daily life, interests, pursuits and circle of friends and acquaintances from many levels of society.]‘John Pedley of Great Barford, 1773-95’, edited by F. G. Emmison. [These entries, selected from the seven volumes of his diaries and omitting the daily references to his health, are laconic but nevertheless give a picture of the busy life of a farmer, on his farm and in the county.]‘Elizabeth Brown of Ampthill, 1778-91’, edited by Joyce Godber. [Elizabeth Brown (1754-1793) was from a Quaker family in Ampthill. The selections from her diary in the few years before and after her marriage to Joshua Wheeler of Hitchin in 1781, and also a Quaker, mainly record her religious life. Only a little about daily, immediate family and business life is recorded.]‘Edward Arpin of Felmersham, 1763-1831’, edited by C. D. Linnell. [Edward Arpin was the grave-digger and parish clerk (1824-1834). These terse notes of local events between 1814 and 1831, include the weather, the price of bread, and the harvest work he did when aged between 60 and 70.]‘Catherine Young (later Maclear) of Bedford, 1832-5 and 1846’, edited by Isobel Thompson. [Catherine Young was from a wealthy family who fell on hard times. She married a clergyman but was widowed and later moved to Bedford in 1831 with two young sons to educate. This selection of one month per annum from a very long diary is aimed at giving a flavour of her life in Bedford society.]‘Sir John Burgoyne, Bart., of Sutton, 1854’, edited by Brigadier P. Young, DSO, MC. [Burgoyne entered the Grenadier Guards in 1850 and served in the Crimean war, was wounded at Alma and sent back to England. He moved to Sutton Park, Sandy in 1861 and served as a justice of the peace, Deputy Lieutenant, High Sheriff and commanded Bedfordshire militia. The diary recounts his journey to the Crimea, army life and the battle Alma.]‘Major J. H. Brooks and the Indian mutiny, 1857’, edited by Aileen M. Armstrong. [This is the text of a lecture given by Major Brooks in 1893 on his experiences in the Indian Mutiny.]‘The Rev. G. D. Newbolt of Souldrop, 1856-95’, edited by Patricia Bell [George Digby Newbolt was presented to the combined livings of Knotting-cum-Souldrop in 1856 and resigned in 1895. The extracts from his diary focus on church matters: services, festivals, income, church furnishings and music.]‘Some letters from Bedfordshire pioneers in Australia, 1842-86’, edited by Andrew Underwood [The six letters are from Charles Cartwright of Millbrook (two letters), a convict; John Feazey of Wilden; Dr George Witt of Bedford; Joel Croxford of Silsoe, a prospector; and Priscilla Dodson of Silsoe. They recount the conditions they encountered in Australia.]  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

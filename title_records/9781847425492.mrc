But is this collaborative discourse really as distinctive as the Labour Government claims? How far do contemporary partnerships exemplify an approach to governing which is based on networks (as distinct from hierarchies and markets)? Partnerships, New Labour and the governance of welfare: provides an up-to-date critical analysis of partnerships; addresses the highly topical theme of 'partnerships' as the means of achieving joined-up government; presents empirical evidence from a wide range of welfare partnerships; examines the relationships between local welfare partnerships and the management of those partnerships by central government; reveals the imbalance of power which characterises many contemporary partnerships. ·  It is essential reading for academics and students of contemporary social and public policy and for those with an interest in networks and other theories of welfare governance.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

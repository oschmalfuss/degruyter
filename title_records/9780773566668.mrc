Agasha Mugasha argues that loan syndications, loan participations, and related practices are commercial transactions between sophisticated parties and should be analysed and regulated as such. Sample documents for syndicated facility agreements, participation agreements, sale and participation agreements, and standby letters of credit are provided in appendices. Based on law in Canada, particularly Ontario, The Law of Multi-bank Financing includes discussions of a significant body of United States jurisprudence as well as the most important court decisions in other common-law countries.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Producing crude oil and natural gas from the subsurface reservoir rocks to the point of the selling terminal requires stage by stage processes that costs several hundreds of millions of dollars to the operating companies. Because of the capital intensive nature of upstream investments, every required process is challenged of its economic impact or benefits it will have on the project’s net present value (NPV). The techniques applied in determining the economics of these processes and their selection criteria are addressed in the book. This book guides the reader through these strategic processes, and presents the participants involved in the business of upstream oil and gas prospecting and the conditions that dictate the field development and investment decisions by investors. It also reveals the shared interests and relationships that exist between international oil companies (IOCs) and national oil companies (NOCs) in the exploration and exploitation of their hydrocarbon resources and reserves. This text will serve the purpose of teaching and learning to those in the energy and financial sectors, as the methods, tools, and techniques discussed throughout the chapters will equip students, tutors, experts, and professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge of Exploration and Production (E&P) projects and energy financing and investment. The principles of project management as it applies in upstream oil/gas projects are discussed as well. And the criteria for project ranking, selection, and budgeting which are sine qua non to project financing and execution are well documented in this book.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

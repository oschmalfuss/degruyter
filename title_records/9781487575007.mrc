Each won a sweeping initial victory, followed by a long tenure of office during which the opposition was ineffective. Both of the first two parties then experienced virtual annihilation at the hands of a new grassroots movement. Despite the non-party tradition which had early become established in the North-West Territories under F.W.G. Haultain, the Liberal party triumphed in the election that followed the founding of the province, and subsequently held office for sixteen years. Why was the victory so sweeping, and why did the Liberal machine eventually break down? Why was the Conservative party unable to establish an effective opposition, and why did the United Farmers of Alberta succeed in dislodging the Liberals when the Conservatives party unable to establish an effective opposition, and why did the United Farmers of Alberta succeed in dislodging the Liberals when the Conservatives had failed? Was there, in fact, a non-party tradition of government that remained alive throughout the whole period of Liberal rule? Do the traditional parties, indeed, seem to the people of the West to have any particular relevance to provincial or territorial affairs, despite apparent willingness to accept them in the federal sphere? Professor Thomas examines these questions thoroughly in tracing the background of politics in Alberta leading up to the rise to power of the Social Credit movement in 1935. His study, based on extensive research in newspaper files and other documents, is a major contribution to Canadian historiography and political science. This book is No. 8 in the Series, Social Credit in Alberta; Its Background and Development.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

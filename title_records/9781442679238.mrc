The book shows how these different activists and their organizations were inter-related, but also how, at the same time, they were very often separated by ideological, cultural, and geographic divisions.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 08.

This book would make a good text for a preparation for life class. . . . The book is written in plain language, unencumbered by a lot of legal citations, and with no expectation that the reader will have any working knowledge of the law.”—Texas Bar Journal “A book any parent should consider giving their child. . . . But before you do, take a look at it yourself. No matter the title, Wallace’s book . . . contains information everyone . . . should know.”—Austin American-Statesman What Every Teen Should Know about Texas Law is the only single-source guide for accurate, easy-to-understand information about most areas of civil law in Texas. L. Jean Wallace drew on years of experience as a students’ attorney at Texas Tech University to inform young adults about the areas of law that affect them most: driving and car ownership, pranks and crimes (including alcohol and drug offenses), personal relationships, employment and consumer concerns, and living on their own. She illustrated her points with true, sometimes humorous, stories of young adults’ encounters with the law. For this new edition, municipal judge Christopher F. Cypert has completely updated the book to reflect the current state of the law. He covers specific topics that are now mandated to be taught in schools, including the proper way to interact with peace officers during traffic stops and other in-person encounters, as well as internet-era misbehaviors such as sexting and cyberbullying. Like Wallace, Cypert has helped many young people navigate the sometimes confusing processes of the legal world, often loaning earlier editions of this book to young offenders in his court. Both authors’ real-world experience and legal expertise ensure that What Every Teen Should Know about Texas Law is indeed a complete and practical guide for assuming the responsibilities of adulthood—as well as a good refresher course for all legal-age Texans.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

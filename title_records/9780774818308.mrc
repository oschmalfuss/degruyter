Kristin Burnett helps to correct this imbalance by investigating the convergence of Aboriginal and settler therapeutic regimes in the Treaty 7 region from the perspective of women. Although the imperial eye focused on medicine men, Aboriginal women played important roles as healers and caregivers, and the knowledge and healing work of both Aboriginal and settler women brought them into contact. But as settlement increased and the colonial regime hardened, informal encounters in domestic spaces gave way to more formal, one-sided interactions in settler-run hospitals and nursing stations. By revealing Aboriginal and settler women's contributions to the development of health care in southern Alberta, Taking Medicine challenges traditional understandings of colonial medicine and nursing in the contact zone.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

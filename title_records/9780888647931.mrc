It details the findings of a study into the role that children's work played in the execution of homesteading operations during the pioneer era between 1871 and 1913. Analyzing the labour of boys and girls, whether helping to build the family home, taking part in productive, subsistence or enterpreneurial tasks, or being responsible for various domestic duties, enables the reader to understand how important children's work was to the success of the family farm. Furthermore, when economic, social, political difficulties, and environmental hazards of the time are also taken into account, the labour contribution of children becomes even more remarkable. Using a variety of archival materials, the author has conducted a study that gives readers a fuller understanding of how families survived, how the wheat economy was developed, and how burdens were carried on the shoulders of the smallest farm labourers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Hymns and spiritual songs are drawn from many countries and many different traditions. A number of hymns appear in their original languages, as well as in English translations.Throughout the hymnal, gender-inclusive language is used wherever possible. The psalms, for example, depend heavily on inclusive-language versions prepared by the United Methodist Church and the National Council of Churches. Also included are many hymns written in the past quarter-century, as well as new texts and music commissioned especially for this collection. The ample selection of hymns by Americans includes the work of hymn writers, composers, and authors such as Aaron Copland, Emma Lou Diemer, Alice Parker, Virgil Thomson, Richard Proulx, Robert Frost, and John Updike.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

From ghost stories and the comic misadventures of the early Miss America Pageant to the dynamics of the changing coastline and poignant portraits of traditional crafts workers, Russell Roberts and Rich Youmans have chronicled the fascinating history and heritage of the New Jersey Shore. In this book you’ll meet the luminaries who’ve frequented the Shore—from President Ulysses Grant strolling through Long Branch to Grace Kelly learning to surf at Ocean City. You’ll find out why the boardwalk was invented, and also why early ones were removable. Join the authors as they pay tribute to the Shore’s forgotten inventors, including Simon Lake, who some consider the true father of the modern submarine. Relive the Jersey Shore’s role in wartime and learn the story of the mysterious Nazi submarine sunken off of Point Pleasant Beach. Read about Lucy the Margate Elephant, as a well as her two long-gone “cousins.” Discover all this and more as Roberts and Youmans explore the vast uncharted heritage of the New Jersey Shore.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

O'Grady clearly shows that Addison wanted to make a difference in the world and did so B her innovations, such as student government and lectures on careers and sex education, were widely copied in other universities. Drawing on archival material and writing in an accessible style, O'Grady captures the flavour of life in Annesley Hall under Addison's regime and uncovers part of the buried mosaic of the lives of Canadian women.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

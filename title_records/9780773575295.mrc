In this detailed family history Peter Hoffmann reveals the tragic and heroic life of Claus, Count Stauffenberg, German aristocrat and would-be assassin of Adolph Hitler. Hoffmann details Stauffenberg's formative years, showing how his relationship with his brothers Berthold and Alexander, their association with the circle of the poet Stefan George, and their professional and political development led them to resist the tyranny of Hitler and the German government, first through established channels but culminating in the attempted assassination and coup of 20 July 1944. Stauffenberg is based on a comprehensive collection of sources, including family papers, correspondence, and information from numerous contemporaries, as well as a unique collection of illustrative material. Hoffmann's knowledge of Stauffenberg was sought for the highly anticipated feature film Valkyrie, for which he served as an advisor. This revised edition includes a new preface by Hoffman and important information he has uncovered since the book was first published.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

The first part of the book examines the development of forms of social organization in Canada over the years 1600 to 1920. In the second and third sections the focus shifts to the general forces in Canadian society shaping the character of institutions and forms of social life. The book concludes with four essays devoted to an examination of the relationship of sociology to history. This volume demonstrates the mutually enriching value of a sociological-historical approach, and is very useful for those interested in communities, social change and organization, and the structure of Canadian society.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Lie group machine learning is a theoretical basis for brain intelligence, Neuromorphic learning (NL), advanced machine learning, and advanced artifi cial intelligence. The book further discusses algorithms and applications in tensor learning, spectrum estimation learning, Finsler geometry learning, Homology boundary learning, and prototype theory. With abundant case studies, this book can be used as a reference book for senior college students and graduate students as well as college teachers and scientific and technical personnel involved in computer science, artifi cial intelligence, machine learning, automation, mathematics, management science, cognitive science, financial management, and data analysis. In addition, this text can be used as the basis for teaching the principles of machine learning. Li Fanzhang is professor at the Soochow University, China.

He concludes the study by drawing comparisons with neighbouring countries and offering some prescriptions for alleviating the violence. Kasozi was assisted by Nakanyike Musisi and James Mukooza Sejjengo, who participated in the research on this book. The Social Origins of Violence in Uganda is one of the most thorough and comprehensive analyses of the causes, levels, and incidence of more than two decades of violence in Uganda.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

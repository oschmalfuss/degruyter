This wide-ranging anthology features a scholarly introduction which provides background to Connolly’s life, career, and influences; and which contextualizes his work both in Ireland and internationally. The collection of texts presented here demonstrates that Connolly’s writings are as pertinent in Ireland and the postcolonial world a century after his execution for leadership of the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland as it was in his own lifetime. The Revolutionary and Anti-Imperialist Writings of James Connolly, 1893-1916 will be a vital and inspiring resource for students, scholars and activists seeking to understand the tumultuous history of early-twentieth century Ireland in both its local and imperial contexts, and looking for the tools to understand the inequities of our globalised world today.Key FeaturesOffers an account of his life and locates his work in the contexts of Irish, imperial and global historyStresses the complex and rich dialectic in his work between socialism and Marxism, and nationalismDemonstrates Connolly’s internationalist and anti-imperialist world-viewLocates Connolly’s work in the context of Irish nationalist and republican revolutionary thought, and international Marxism and anti-imperialism"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

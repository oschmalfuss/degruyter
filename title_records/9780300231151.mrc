Amber is juggling two nearly full-time jobs and three kids. Her on-again, off-again husband Chris is eternally optimistic and charming as hell, but rarely employed. The house is falling apart and Amber has an eight-year-old's birthday party to plan.   Selected from more than 1,600 entries, Schwend's newest play-produced by the Amoralists Theatre Company at Rattlestick Playwrights Theatre in 2016-vividly captures the economic hardships and relationship difficulties faced by so many Americans today. "Utility is a remarkable play: beautifully written and effortlessly powerful," said contest judge Nicholas Wright. "At every moment the happiness of human lives is put at risk: is there any greater dramatic theme?"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

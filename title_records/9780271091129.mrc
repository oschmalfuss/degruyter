In 1521 he wrote several pamphlets urging a reform of the Mass. In 1524 he broke with Martin Luther and published a second group of pamphlets rejecting the traditional belief in Christ&apos;s corporeal presence in the Eucharist. Despite the importance of Karlstadt&apos;s tracts, they are little known today, and his understanding of the Lord&apos;s Supper is often reduced to a caricature. For the first time, Amy Nelson Burnett translates his thirteen pamphlets into English, illuminating Karlstadt&apos;s importance for the Reformation debate over the Eucharist and his contribution to what would become Reformed sacramental theology.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

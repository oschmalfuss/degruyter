The authors also consider the consequences of the federal government's February 1992 decision to close the international sports relations section in External Affairs and subsume its functions under the corresponding unit in Fitness and Amateur Sport. Grounding this study in transnational relations theory, the authors argue that sport and international relations can no longer be understood only in terms of traditional, "realist" theories of international politics. Placing recent developments in sport in the context of broader trends in international politics, they offer observations and speculations about the future role of international sport and, in particular, the IOC in the new world of interdependence.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Despite its continuing relevance to current social policy issues both in the UK and internationally, much of Titmuss's work is now out of print. This book brings together a selection of his most important writings on a range of key social policy issues, together with commentary on these from contemporary experts in the field. The book should be read by undergraduate and postgraduate students in social policy and sociology, for many of whom Titmuss remains compulsory reading. It will be of interest to academics and other policy analysts as well as students and academics in political science and social work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

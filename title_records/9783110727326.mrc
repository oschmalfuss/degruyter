However, cross-linguistically, modal auxiliaries can co-occur with one another, but under interesting restrictions. This monograph examines layered modal constructions and the semantic restrictions under which they combine. The main puzzle addressed in the book is the question of ordering restrictions among modal auxiliaries and whether these have any semantic consequences, and finally, what the conceptual rationale is behind these restrictions. Based on the data from Croatian, the central proposal is that modal restrictions depend heavily on both modal force and flavour, and combine according to a hierarchy that can possibly be extended cross-linguistically since it rests on the basis of the conceptual and logical reality of human language. The book also offers an in-depth overview of the literature on layered modal constructions as well as a valuable and extensive set of analyzed data which will be of great interest for researchers interested in verbal systems, modality, and Slavic languages.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

Peter Golato's research offers an insightful account of the lexical storage and retrieval of isolated words and words within sentences.Processing French investigates the native-language processing of French, a language for which findings have not definitively supported a dual-mechanism account of morphological processing. Through word- and sentence-level studies, the book accomplishes two goals. First, it offers behavioral evidence in support of a dual-mechanism processing account at the word level. In contrast to English, however, the evidence with French does not turn upon a contrast in inflectional regularity among verbs but instead hinges upon a diachronic contrast, with synchronic relevance, in the productivity of derivational suffixes among nouns. Second, by incorporating the findings of the word-level studies into sentence-level studies, the book offers a window onto the morphological processing of displaced sentential elements, specifically morphologically simple and complex wh-moved nouns and raised lexical verbs.Peter Golato is assistant professor of French at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."Processing French is decidedly original, and it is equally and decidedly sound. This book makes a superb shelf reference for anybody working in psycholinguistics, first- and second-language acquisition, and the syntactic study of French.and draws some fascinating conclusions about what might really be at play in human language acquisition." -Fred Davidson, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

But unlike so many other social media platforms that have crumbled under tough conditions, Twitter is still alive—and thriving.How did Twitter turn itself around in one of the most turbulent and competitive industries? The change management approach of authors Gregory P. Shea and Cassie A. Solomon guided a significant area of the organization's turnaround effort.In this revised and updated edition of Leading Successful Change, Shea and Solomon share success stories from a host of companies including Twitter, Viacom, and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, offering a tested method for leading successful change, which they have developed over a combined 50 years of helping organizations do just that.In Leading Successful Change, Shea and Solomon share:Why most change efforts failThe two key tenets for making successful changeHow to create a scene that will provide a vision of the futureThe 8 Levers of Change, a tried-and-true method for designing the work environment to support the changesHow winning companies—from IKEA to Whirlpool—are successfully implementing changeChange is not optional and it is difficult—but it is also not impossible—with Leading Successful Change."A must-use guide for anyone who is faced with leading others to a future that is better than today."—Annie McKee, author, How to Be Happy at Work."Greg Shea and Cassie Solomon have written a novel and valuable resource for leaders of change."—Michael Useem, Professor of Management, The Wharton School, and author, The Leader's Checklist"Wonderfully concise."—Richard J.

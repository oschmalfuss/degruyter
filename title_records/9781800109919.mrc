Reflecting on that rich source, this multifaceted volume provides a valuable set of case studies on topics that are not often treated on their own, but which are vital contexts of Victorian art. By addressing the artistic work, practices and social circles of all three artists it reminds us that there is much more to this period than the Pre-Raphaelites, and that other styles and movements (such Aesthetic painting, to which Joanna and George Boyce contributed) flourished in their shade.The experiences of Victorian artists and the realities of their world are brought to life as we follow the three painters' travels to continental European cities and their artistic training in Britain and France. We see them explore differing paint mediums and processes, become a part of the art market (its studios, clubs and societies), form relationships with patrons and take on other roles within the British artworld. We learn about the progress of women artists, as reflected in Joanna Boyce's career. George Boyce's unique vision is readdressed and the book also includes the first, full study of the career of Henry Wells, including his active involvement with the Royal Academy, taking us into the later decades of the nineteenth century.By virtue of their differing artistic journeys the Boyce family artists provide a broad and multi-angled view of the mid-nineteenth century British art world. The essays by writers with a rich range of expertise - in art history, curation, materiality and life writing - explore Victorian artists' significant contributions to and interactions within their world.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

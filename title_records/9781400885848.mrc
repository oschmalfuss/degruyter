While observers have disagreed as to whether black politicians act differently from their white counterparts, little empirical work has been done because until recently there were few blacks in office. Leonard A. Cole's analysis of elected officials in New Jersey has an important bearing on the controversy.Originally published in 1976.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Increasingly, cyber security practitioners are confronted with a stark phrase: cyber terrorism. For many, it conveys fear and hopelessness. What is this thing called ‘cyber terrorism’ and what can we begin to do about it?   Malicious-minded ICT users, programmers and even programs (including much AI-powered software) have all been instrumental in recruiting, inspiring, training, executing and amplifying acts of terrorism. This has resulted in the loss of life and/or life-changing physical injuries that could never have occurred without support and facilitation from the cyber sphere. These types of attacks can be encapsulated by the phrase ‘cyber terrorism’.    This book recounts case studies to show the types of threats we face and provides a comprehensive coverage of risk management tactics and strategies to protect yourself against such nefarious threat actors. These include key mitigation and controls for information security or security and HR-related professionals.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

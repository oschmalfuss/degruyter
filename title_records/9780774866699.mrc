The Liberals had been in office for two decades when the 1957 election was called and were widely expected to win another majority government. But new Conservative leader John Diefenbaker completely overshadowed his opponents. Highlighting Liberal arrogance, Diefenbaker seized the opportunity that television and boisterous, supportive rallies offered to present his vision of a new Canada. He was ultimately victorious. A second election in 1958 resulted in a landslide victory, with the Liberals reduced to their smallest number of seats since Confederation, the CCF reduced to eight seats and losing its leader, and Social Credit wiped out completely. It was a rout never before seen in Canadian history. Revival and Change is the story of those elections, the government and opposition they produced, the issues that defined the government, and the era’s legacy in Canadian politics and society.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

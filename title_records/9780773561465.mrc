He also examinines factors which influence the accuracy of forecasts and reviews the record of Canadian forecasting. In the last chapters Daub considers public policy aspects of economic forecasting. Should forecasters be held liable for inaccurate forecasts? Should they be subject to regulation? He concludes by observing that the practice of forecasting is inextricably linked to our sense of time, as is the very different exercise of time-keeping with clocks or watches. It is socially complex, highly institutionalized, and informed by the many and varied visions we carry of the world. Through it we attempt to organize and shape our individual and collective futures. Until uncertainty is eliminated from human affairs, forecasting will continue to be a necessary social practice, despite recurring bouts of cynicism as to its worth.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

In The Quotable Machiavelli, Maurizio Viroli, one of the world's leading Machiavelli scholars, offers a rich collection of the Florentine's most memorable words on a wide range of subjects, including politics, the human condition, religion, love and happiness, antiquity and history, patriotism, and virtue. Drawing on Machiavelli's entire body of writings, and including little-known "ations as well as famous passages, the book shows the full scope of his thought and belies the cliché that he was a "Machiavellian" cynic. In addition to Machiavelli's own words on dozens of subjects of perennial interest, the book includes some almost unknown texts in which his contemporaries describe him. Complete with a biographical introduction, the book serves as a handy reference and a smart and lively introduction to a masterly thinker and writer.Includes a rich collection of Machiavelli's most memorable words on a wide range of subjects, from politics to the human condition-almost 700 "ations in allEdited and introduced by one of the world's leading Machiavelli scholarsServes as a smart and lively introduction to Machiavelli's life and worksDraws on the complete body of Machiavelli's writingsFeatures a brief biography of Machiavelli, a chronology of his life, suggestions for further reading, and an index  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

The format has been revised, new concepts and terms have been added, and previous definitions have been clarified and updated. "Anyone learning, teaching, or writing about psychoanalysis will find [this book] of uncommon usefulness and value. . . . The editing is superb, . . . the text [is] clear and concise, . . . jargon [has been] minimized, . . . and qualifiers avoid dogmatism. Early misconceptions (about female development and sexuality) are corrected, and the changes are consistent throughout the book. If one is building a personal psychoanalytic library, this should head the list of what to purchase next."-William D. Jeffrey, Bulletin of the Psychoanalytic Association of New York "The best quick reference available for psychoanalytic terms.Should be part of every psychoanalyst's reference library."-Psychoanalytic Books: A Quarterly Journal of Reviews "A book that offers well-written definitions and explanations of psychoanalytic terms. . . . There is much to recommend this volume to students, teachers, clinicians, and scientists."-David B. Allison, American Journal of Psychiatry "Transcends the danger of dry mandatory definitions with exhilarating short essays. . . These succinct summaries make this book a lively piece that will appeal to the experienced student as well as the beginner."-Carl F.

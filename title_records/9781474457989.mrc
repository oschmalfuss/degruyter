E. Tobias and Benjamin William Brown. Their narratives are reproduced alongside an in-depth introductory essay, author biographies, scholarly annotations and a detailed bibliography.All these authors testify to their lifelong 'fight for freedom' across their radical and revolutionary works. Throughout their lives, they warred against the 'sufferings and horrors' of enslavement as a centuries-old 'cursed institution.' 'Words are weapons' in their fight for Black liberation. Across their life's works, they protested against the rise of the 'spirit of slavery' in white supremacist and white racist American and British transatlantic societies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

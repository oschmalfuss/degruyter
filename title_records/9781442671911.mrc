Lack of international confidence, fall of the dollar, weaknesses in the industrial sector, and near record levels of unemployment more than tested the Trudeau government. Donald Macdonald followed John Turner out of finance and was replaced by Jean Chretien, the first francophone minister of finance in Canadian history. A final decision on the northern pipeline ended years of debate, but the activities of the RCMP at home and Canadian crown corporations and multinationals abroad more than filled the gap.Quebec's Charter of the French Language moved the province sharply towards unilingualism, but did not destroy the educational rights of the existing anglophone minority. The Levesque government planned its referendum, while Trudeau toyed with the idea of a national referendum and kept the question of constitutional revision alive. On tthe international front Canada applied economic sanctions against South Africa, co-chaired the conference on international economic co-operation, and negotiated an historic arctic pipeline agreement with the United States. In Ontario the Davis government was returned, its minority intact, but in Manitoba Ed Schreyer went down to defeat at the hands of the Conservatives.Across the country provincial finance ministers told the same tale of spending restraints and belt-tightening.The 1977 edition of the Canadian Annual Review is both a concise, convenient record of the year but a responsible appraisal of important developments. Compiled by a corps of Canadian scholars and experts writing under the direction of an outstanding Canadian historian and political commentator, it is authoritative and eminently readable. The articles can be read consecutively for interest and instruction, or they can be spot read with ease to locate particular information. A detailed and thorough index greatly enhances the value of this annual, now in its eighteeth year as an indispensable reference book for those concerned directly or indirectly with Canadian public affairs.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

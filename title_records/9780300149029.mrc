This book is a unique, personal account of Cold War combat over the airwaves, of psychological battles that succeeded in eroding the international appeal of the Soviet system and ultimately in helping to bring about the implosion of the Soviet empire.A leading expert on East and Central European and Soviet affairs, George R. Urban offers an insider's perspective on the history of Radio Free Europe by drawing on his service during the 1960s and his term as overall director in the 1980s. In vivid detail Urban describes how the Radios promoted the cause of liberal democracy and the free market economy for more than four decades and stood up against the Soviet system, with its clandestine offshoots and fifth columns in all the countries of the West. Urban contends that a second opponent was less visible but more powerful: influential members of the American and West European Left who believed the Soviet superpower should not be thwarted. The author explores the often controversial strategies and tactics employed by the staff and administrators of the Radios, sheds light on their role in the tragic 1956 Hungarian Revolution, examines the ideas and convictions of key figures, and reveals how communism was intellectually unmasked in a psychological contest that also made possible reconciliation between nations and individuals.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

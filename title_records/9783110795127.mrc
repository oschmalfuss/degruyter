By now, scholarship has undergone a positive change in attitude towards these authors and their works. This book contributes to this modern picture of late antiquity as a vibrant and fascinating period through close analysis of the work of Aetius of Amida (6th century CE). It offers the very first modern translation of chapters 1–10 of the sixth book of Aetius’ Libri medicinales as well as a detailed commentary on these chapters. Together with an extensive introduction it thus makes Aetius’ treatise accessible to a wider audience and takes into account Aetius’ craft as a compiler by analyzing his literary and compilation techniques. Book 6 of Aetius’ compilation is especially interesting because it deals with diseases of the brain and thus also discusses mental illnesses such as phrenitis, melancholia or mania. Therefore, this volume also sheds light on the treatment of brain diseases in late antiquity and furthers our understanding of the history of mental disorders in ancient medical texts.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

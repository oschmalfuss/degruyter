The debates raise some fundamental questions: Who are military anthropologists? What do they do? In response, the authors of Practicing Military Anthropology offer deeply personal accounts of their paths to becoming military anthropologists, what their choices have meant both professionally and personally, and the challenges that they have confronted throughout their careers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

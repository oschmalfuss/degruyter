His teaching involved close attention not merely to medicine itself but to all the scientific and philosophical learning of the time. His pupils, in turn, included some of the leading learned physicians in Italy in the early fourteenth century. In a study of the professional thought and practice of these physicians, Nancy Siraisi shows how their intellectual and medical achievements were integrated with the soical and institutional context within which they lived.Focusing specifically on Taddeo Alderotti and six of his pupils, the author treats what is known of their lives, their teaching activites, their learned writings, their medical practice, and their broader moral outlook. She pays particular attention to the theoretical concepts of meidcal learning, the relationship of medicine to natural philosophy, the correlation of medical theory to medical practice, and the role of the physician as a citizen.Nancy G. Siraisi is Professor of History at Hunter College of the City University of New York.Originally published in 1981.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

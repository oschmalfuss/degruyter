Policymakers are becoming increasingly interested in the Community Economic Development approach as a way of achieving this aim. In Entrepreneurship and Community Economic Development Monica Diochon examines the development processes adopted by two rural, single-industry Canadian communities confronting the collapse of their economic bases. She argues that a community's effectiveness in influencing economic development depends on the extent to which entrepreneurship is encouraged and shows that, while a number of factors influence enterprise, economic activities that are community-determined and provide varied opportunities to participate in achieving short-term self-sustaining strategic outcomes are particularly important.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

The major portion of the book deals with concrete field realities in Sri Lanka, working with and learning from impoverished farmers, young community organizers, irrigation engineers, government officials, and others involved in an impressive reversal of circumstances.Uphoff shows how mainstream social science frameworks proved inadequate to explain or achieve the mobilization of people's cooperative efforts to improve productivity and the quality of life in rural Sri Lanka. He found himself—much to his surprise—assisted by concepts emerging from twentieth-century physics—from relativity theory, quantum mechanics, and, especially, chaos theory.Drawing lessons from this engaging experiment in social change, Learning from Gal Oya suggests how social science can move beyond its sixteenth- and seventeenth century moorings, benefit from some of the intellectual advances of the twentieth century, and contribute more effectively to improving the human condition. The book speaks not only to readers and issues in the fields of comparative politics and development administration. With its avoidance of social science jargon and its interpretive approach to concrete experience, it will also be accessible and attractive to humanists and other readers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

It was originally developed in order to manage a rapid growth in the cost and complexity of IT systems, using knowledge gained from software structure and design. For this reason, enterprise architecture is often thought of as a component of IT governance. However, the discipline has evolved and extended its scope. Enterprise architecture is now about structuring business capabilities and processes in order to support your long-term business strategy. Effective application of enterprise architecture will enable you to improve your productivity and performance. This pocket guide offers you an invaluable introduction to this business-critical subject. It explains the function of enterprise architecture within the organisation, looks at the skills needed within the enterprise architecture team and provides an overview of the most common enterprise architecture frameworks. As the author emphasises, enterprise architecture is not about creating models and designs for their own sake, but about using these structures to serve the needs of the business. Benefits to business include: Make better decisions As a discipline, enterprise architecture helps companies to understand the way that their component systems (e.g. security, business continuity or performance management) all fit together. The pocket guide will show you how enterprise architecture can lead to better decision making Improve business effectiveness Enterprise architecture maintains a holistic view of the organisation, taking into account different issues, such as efficient use of resources and reliable delivery of services, and showing how they relate to one another.

Deploying religious and historical iconography drawn from Spain’s centuries-long struggle against Islam, Francoist ideologues created a kitsch interpretation of Spain’s historical past designed to replace more complex and nuanced accounts, where religious and historical iconography combined with kitsch aesthetics to project a picturesque, clichéd image of Spain. The ultimate goal of this vast production of Francoist kitsch was to produce a submissive subject who, by identifying with Francoist aesthetics, would identify with state ideology.This book engages with the making and unmaking of Francoist kitsch aesthetics through the analysis of Spanish cinema. It examines five highly influential Francoist films produced from 1938 until 1964 and three later films by critically acclaimed directors Luis Buñuel, Guillermo del Toro, and Alex de la Iglesia that attempt to undermine Francoist aesthetics by re-imagining its visual and narrative clichés.Key featuresA comprehensive analysis of totalitarian kitsch aesthetics and Spanish fascismAn exploration of the links between cinema and politics in Franco and Post-Franco SpainIn-depth film analysis of several Spanish films anchored in historical contextsTheoretical approach to Spanish cinema and kitsch aestheticsClose analysis of films by critically acclaimed directors Luis Buñuel, Alex de la Iglesia and Guillermo del Toro  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

She first grounds her interpretation of the theatrical gaze historically in the context of the humanistic tradition of right spectatorship and the Renaissance countertradition of trick perspectives; she then traces the use of the gaze from its roots in Renaissance optics and strategies of learned ignorance through Freud, Merleau-Ponty, and Lacan, to recent appropriations of Lacanian thought by feminism, deconstruction, cultural materialism, and film theory. In chapters on The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Twelfth Night, Freedman shows how critical reception of the comedies repeats their games with error and distortion, denial and projection, optical politics and gender ideology. Her readings illuminate the counteraccusations of competing critical theories, and suggest that the comedies may serve as a means for rethinking the nature of spectatorship in contemporary theater and film.Staging the Gaze will be essential reading for Shakespeare scholars, for students of Renaissance literature, and for others interested in the controversies surrounding postmodern theory.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

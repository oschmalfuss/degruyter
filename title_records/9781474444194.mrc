He identifies the pressures for change – giving a clearer understanding of how and why the contemporary law is designed and operates as it does.Norrie traces particular issues in legislative detail, including court processes, the changing thresholds for state intervention, the increasing regulation of children’s homes and foster care, the developing rules on corporal punishment and the earlier practice of compulsory emigration to the colonies of children removed from their parents. The transformation of adoption is also covered in comprehensive detail. In drawing out key themes and common threads, Norrie sets contemporary developments against their historical context and offers a fuller understanding of child protection law in Scotland.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

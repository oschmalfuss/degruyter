It focuses on alternative legal and political practices established by the PKK (Kurdistan Worker’s Party) such as local policing, informal judicial mechanisms and taxing, and shows how this divergence from state-led systems forges a sense of community among Kurds and creates a de-facto parallel state. It pays particular attention to the Kurdish political movement’s success in achieving its aim of redressing gender-based injustices to create an equal society.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

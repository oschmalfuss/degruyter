It covers the German acquisition of Kiautschou in 1897, which had profound consequences for China, beginning a "scramble for concessions" by other western powers; the formation of the powerful German East Asiatic Cruiser Squadron which was seen by the British as a major threat, andwhich resulted in the advent of the Fleet-Unit concept and the birth of the Royal Australian Navy; the Japanese siege and capture of the key German base of Tsingtau in 1914, and the fate of the various former German colonies afterGermany's defeat in 1918. The book contains many illustrations from the author's extensive private collection.

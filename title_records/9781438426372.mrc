Drawing on a wealth of sources, some newly discovered, author Anthony F. Gero tells of their two centuries of struggle and triumph, beginning with the French and Indian War and continuing until 1950, when the United States Army and New York's National Guard became integrated. Their legacy is vividly illustrated by the heroism of the 369th United States Infantry (previously the 15th New York) during the American advance in the Argonne-Meuse in 1918. Private Dorrance Brooks from New York City was killed in action as he led his company's survivors forward after all its officers had been killed or wounded. Black Soldiers of New York State demonstrates how in spite of many obstacles—including ongoing prejudice within their own country—the African American soldiers from New York State served courageously and valiantly, winning many commendations and earning the respect of friend and foe alike.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

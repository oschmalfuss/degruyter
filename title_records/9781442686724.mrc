However, there has not been until now a basic practice text for guiding professional education and skill building across diverse areas. Filling this significant gap, Partnering with Parents is a primer on family-centred practice for professionals working in children’s health and developmental services.The material in this textbook spans interdisciplinary training across key child service sectors (particularly child development, child mental health, and children’s health). The authors identify and discuss the key principles of the model as it is practiced in Canada, with a focus on working alliances, empowerment methods, and the development of social support resources. Providing examples of the application of family-centred practice in a wide range of service settings, Partnering with Parents will be useful for the social workers, nurses, psychologists, and allied health professionals who work together in complex service situations.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

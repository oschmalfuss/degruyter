Priority is given to the most recent critical works and editions, provided that they supersede previous ones; however, earlier scholarly work and critical editions of texts that are now regarded as classics are also included. Because of the highly selective nature of this bibliography, Rachel Bromwich includes only a few studies on early legal texts, historical background, ecclesiastical learning, hagiography, archaeology and art, and folklore. The bibliography is divided into five chapters, of which two are intended for newcomers to the field and list the more available works of reference and aids to language study. The remaining three are devoted to literary history and criticism, texts and translations, and background material. The more than 500 entries have been arranged to show the ways in which the medieval literature of Ireland and Wales pursue parallel courses. In each chapter a general and comparative section is followed by sub-sections dealing with Irish material (including Cornish and Breton). Within each of these sub-sections individual items dealing with similar or closely related topics have been grouped together. Since this work is intended primarily for students working in English, the majority of the listings are in English, but important works in Irish, Welsh, French, and German are also cited.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

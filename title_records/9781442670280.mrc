Although injury reduction targets have been established and indicators have been developed to measure progress in prevention, no method of evaluating and accessing effective injury prevention practices is currently available.This compendium aims to fill this gap by portraying exemplars that have the potential to reduce the incidence of these injuries, and by providing a detailed methodology that is effective in identifying innovative best practices. The intention of this work is not to be encyclopaedic; rather, the authors have reviewed the twenty-eight best and promising practices, taking into consideration the complexity of injury dynamics, and analysed what constitutes a best practice as the shift is made from individual clinical practice to the collective practice associated with policy implementation at the community level.The first worldwide assessment of best practices, this work is expected to be an important contribution to the emerging field of unintentional-injury prevention with its unique coverage of the life span, up-to-date bibliography, and directory of the major programs and professionals.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

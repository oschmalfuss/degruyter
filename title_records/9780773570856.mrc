He explores the relationship between the hospital's urban and rural constituencies and its French- and English-speaking patients, demonstrating that increasing patient numbers and changing funding sources encouraged substantial growth in hospital services from 1895 to 1953. He details how one community's understanding of the role of the hospital changed over time to match that of hospital advocates, board members, and support groups such as the Ladies' Aid, demonstrating that hospital history is as much a study of politics and community persuasion as it is of internal therapeutic advances.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

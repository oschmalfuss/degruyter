This book traces how and why the subgenre has continued to endure, even as we enter a post-cinematic landscape.Through three distinct sections, Blood on the Lens proposes key observations on the found footage horror subgenre. She questions how these films engage with national trauma, the common themes of this body of films and how they relate to wider anxieties. In addition, McMurdo investigates the effect various cultural movements have had on the aesthetics of found footage horror, how these films position their spectator and encourage an active viewing mode, and how the line between fiction and fact is blurred both paratextually and within the films themselves.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

On the Political Economy of Social Democracy stresses Weldon's recognition of the vital connection between social democracy and political democracy. It provides a clear understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of economic and social policy -- a necessary understanding, Weldon maintained, for the success of social democratic government. Weldon's commitment to social democracy in Canada is also reflected in the role he played in the New Democratic Party, his willingness to support and assist unions, and his efforts to achieve social justice. These selected papers originally appeared between 1961 and 1986. The issues they examine are now in the forefront of economic policy debates in most industrialized nations. They will interest not only scholars but anyone interested in the fate of a democratic political philosophy that has had considerable influence in shaping Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

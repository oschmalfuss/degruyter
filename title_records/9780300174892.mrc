What constitutes a nutritious school lunch? How do I deal with my adolescent's eating needs and habits? Will my children receive proper nutrients if they are sick, very athletic, or vegetarians? This authoritative resource answers these and dozens of other questions, not only presenting the latest scientific knowledge about nutrition but also providing recipes from famous chefs for delicious and healthy dishes. The book, written by physicians and dietitians at the Yale University School of Medicine, an international leader in pediatric teaching, research, and clinical care, as well as by dieticians, nurses, and social workers at the Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital, is the most authoritative, comprehensive, and informative guide to childhood nutrition ever produced.The Yale Guide to Children's Nutrition includes:• information about nutritional needs at the different stages of childhood and adolescence;• advice on how to cope with a picky eater and what to feed a sick child;• special nutritional requirements for children with high cholesterol, eating disorders, allergies, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, metabolic disorders, and other conditions;• explanations of such nutritional components as calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins-and examples of foods that are sources for each of them;• suggestions for healthy snacks;• ideas for eating in restaurants with children;• recipes provided by restaurants and chefs from all over the United States.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

He explores the influence of poets such as François Villon, Guido Cavalcanti, Robert Burns, Robert Browning, Algernon Charles Swinburne and Walt Whitman on Pound's lyrical style. For Stark, Pound's multi-vocalism arises out of his interest in dialect and the acoustic qualities of speech which leads to a 'modern' barbarous language marked by polysemy and heterogeneity.Key Features: Marries two discrete strands in Pound scholarship: his fastidious obsession with poetic craft and his furious pursuit of eruditionDescribes a simple, but revolutionary, approach to poetic form, taking account of the total organization of sound in a poem without dwelling on arcane scholarly terminologyExamines Pound's famous style in a pre-modern context where we can better gauge what was at stake in the author's trailblazing invention of ModernismProvides detailed, practical assistance to Pound's readers, especially in its detailed close reading of almost totally neglected early poems by this notoriously difficult writer  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

If they fail, the whole economy fails. How to Build a Bank sets out, in a manner that is completely unprecedented, all the requirements for the core documentation essential for the operation of a bank. The book takes the reader through the core requirements to operate a bank, and then provides actual examples of the relevant regulatory documentation required for the bank‘s operation, the rationale for the documentation and the details and information required to complete the documentation. Each chapter of the book includes a template of the key regulatory documents required to operate a bank. The book thus simplifies a very complex area of regulatory and banking laws and rules to enable a better understanding of the banking sector and a better understanding of the key requirements for a successful long-term banking business. It is essential reading for bank executives, financial service executives, regulators, lawyers, accountants and professionals involved in bank and financial service authorisation and bank and financial service operations. It will also be very helpful for anyone wishing to understand how the most important business institutions in an economy work and the lessons that can be learned from understanding the detailed regulatory requirements to ensure their success and long-term viability.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

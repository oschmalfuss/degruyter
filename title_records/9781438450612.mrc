The women profiled are amateur practitioners of Noh theater, learning the dance and chant essential to this classic art form. Using a combination of observational, interview, and experiential data, Katrina L. Moore discusses the relevance of these practices to the women's everyday lives. Later life learning activities have been heavily promoted in Japan as a means for an aging population to remain healthy. However, many Noh practitioners experience their practice as a means of self-actualization beyond the goal of healthy aging. Looking at daily experiences of training for and staging theatrical performances, Moore analyzes the way the body becomes the medium through which amateurs explore new states of self. The work provides a view of contemporary Noh that highlights the rarely acknowledged role of amateur performers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

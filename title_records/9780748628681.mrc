He was a man of apparent contradictions: a partisan Tory with Radical friends; an upholder of oral tradition who eagerly embraced every new development in early nineteenth-century print culture; a man who wrote against biographical intrusions yet in his own life writing, stories and poems emphasised his persona and origins as the Ettrick Shepherd. His formidable intelligence and drive were seldom acknowledged, and his most challenging work disturbed conventional readerly preconceptions. Key FeaturesDocuments a life from ragged boy cowherd to famous author.Gives due weight to the neglected parts of Hogg's story for the first time.Draws extensively on Hogg's correspondence and a rich archive of documentary material.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

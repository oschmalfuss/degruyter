The essays are divided into six sections: economic, demographic, and institutional factors underlying the postwar demand for housing; principal aspects of the supply side of housing, including housing finance, technology, and regulation; housing-stock growth and changes in housing quality; the balance of supply and demand in terms of adequacy, suitability, and affordability; the changing settlement environment; and lessons, challenges, and issues for the future. The book also contains valuable summaries of housing policy initiatives undertaken between 1945 and 1986. An essential reference document on urban housing and city development in the postwar period in Canada, House, Home, and Community will be valuable to academics, planners, professionals, and students with interests related to housing.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

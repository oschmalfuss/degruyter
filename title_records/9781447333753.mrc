The book explores key questions about the empowerment and capacity-building of minority ethnic groups. Using case studies from across the ‘developed’ world, and in differing social and economic contexts, contributors explore these issues in working with asylum-seeker communities, addressing tensions between minorities and building alliances, in work with Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, and using arts-based approaches. The book will stimulate wider debates about the role of community development in relation to ‘race’ and ethnicity at a time when ‘race’ is being ‘invisibilised’ in public policy, and will be an invaluable resource for policy-makers, politicians, academics, and students from many disciplines.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

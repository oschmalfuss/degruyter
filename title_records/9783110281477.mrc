As in the previous volumes, minimal nonabelian p-groups play an important role. Topics covered in this volume include: subgroup structure of metacyclic p-groups Ishikawa’s theorem on p-groups with two sizes of conjugate classes p-central p-groups theorem of Kegel on nilpotence of H p-groups partitions of p-groups characterizations of Dedekindian groups norm of p-groups p-groups with 2-uniserial subgroups of small order The book also contains hundreds of original exercises and solutions and a comprehensive list of more than 500 open problems. This work is suitable for researchers and graduate students with a modest background in algebra.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

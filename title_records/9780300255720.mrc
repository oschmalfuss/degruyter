It is also a thoughtful investigation into the way that writing is inescapably enmeshed with time. Myles recounts how potential eviction from their apartment; relationships with friends, lovers, and neighbors; and the textures and identities of various cities, including New York and Marfa, Texas, all present a sense of writing as presence within time. “Once I tasted time I never wanted anything else. . . . The only way I can prove it is that I started writing. Writing is my alibi,” they note. The author concludes that writing is a form of loving that makes living “more beautiful” because “I have time for it, I am in it.”  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

The book comprehensively covers the issue of warm-up in football. In the first part of the book, the authors present a detailed description of the methodology for conducting the warm-up taking into account its diverse structures and patterns of well-known theorists and practitioners. The first author of the study made an innovative division of the football warm-up into its types, as well as kinds depending on the nature of the conducted classes. The next part of the book provides a variety of practical examples of warm-up before tournaments and trainings. A wide range of practice settings, examples of practical warm-up solutions used by teams of different levels of the game (from national teams to the Champions League teams, lower leagues, as well as youth teams), as well as plenty of the first author's proposals are presented.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

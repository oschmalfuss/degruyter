She soon married Harold Parke, a former NWMP officer, and spent the next decade recording her experiences in a series of notebooks sent to her Ontario family. Few women's diaries have survived from that time, and Barrett Parke recalls a period of profound transformation in a region newly opened to white settlement by the railway. She was an astute observer and an exceptional writer, and her diaries provide invaluable insights into work, health, religion, race and gender relations, and women's lives. On a personal level, her writings show the conflict between her independent spirit and women's traditional roles. Although wary of the emerging feminism of the time, Alice was co-opted into the "vice-regal circle" of the Countess of Aberdeen, who stayed at nearby Coldstream Ranch, and became the first corresponding secretary of the Vernon chapter of the National Council of Women. Careful editing and additional research to contextualize the social and historical background, as well as biographical details, photos, and maps enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of this remarkable woman's life, and the lives of those around her. Selected as a BC Book for Everybody.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

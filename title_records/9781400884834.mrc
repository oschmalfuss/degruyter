This revised edition includes eight new walks, several of which have been created on land that has been preserved since the popular guide was originally published in 2009. The walks range from two to four miles, but many include suggestions for trail connections that allow you to extend your hike if you choose. The guide includes detailed color maps of the trails, directions on how to get to them and where to park, and recommendations for the most scenic routes. Each walk has been designed with a "reason to walk" in mind: a special boulder or waterfall to find, a bit of local history or a beautiful vista to enjoy. The guide is illustrated with specially commissioned color photographs, sixteen of which are featured on detachable postcards.A guide to 16 trails through preserved open space in Princeton and neighboring townsDirections for how to get there and where to parkDetailed walking directions, trail distances, and color trail mapsSuggestions for connections to other trails8 new walks are featured in this revised edition, including the Scott and Hella McVay Poetry Trail, the Stony Brook Trail, and the trails at St. Michaels Farm PreserveSpecially commissioned color photographs16 detachable color postcardsProceeds benefit D&R Greenway Land Trust, Friends of Princeton Open Space, and The Stony Brook Millstone Watershed Association to support trail maintenance and land stewardship  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

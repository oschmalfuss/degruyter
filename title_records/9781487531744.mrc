This collection offers a new analytical framework for interdisciplinary scholarship on health worker migration using a lens of embodied value and its transfer in the process of international migration. This volume provides key insights into economistic and feminist concepts of global value transmission, complexity of health worker migration, and the gendered and intersectional intricaciesy involved in the mobility and workplace integration of immigrant health care workers. The contributions to this edited collection uncover the multitude of actors , beyond the sending and receiving countries and migrants themselves, who play a role in creating, transmitting, transforming and utilizing the value embedded in international health migrants.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

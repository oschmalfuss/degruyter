After many years of investigation throughout a long and distinguished career, this book represents Marvin Farber's definitive answer to the question of the nature and function of philosophy. Originally a follower of Husserl, Farber can be credited with bringing phenomenology to the attention of American philosophy. In his later years, he abandoned phenomenology for a kind of naturalism and subsequently called himself a Marxist.This volume, which he had been working on since his retirement from active teaching, is the culmination of Farber's analytical abilities. His earlier career was highlighted with many milestones as well. Along with publishing Phenomenology as a Method and as a Philosophical Discipline in 1928 (his first book which served to introduce phenomenology to the United States), Farber organized the International Phenomenological Society. He became its first president in 1931 and began publishing the journal Philosophy and Phenomenological Research the next year. In 1940 he published Philosophical Essays in Memory of Edmund Husserl, a collection of essays by a number of Husserl's more distinguished followers, many of whom had emigrated to the United States. Farber's other books include: Foundation of Phenomenology; Naturalism and Subjectivism; he coauthored Philosophy for the Future: The Quest of Modern Materialism.The Search for an Alternative considers the nature of philosophy, discussing Husserl, Marx, Lenin, and Farber's own ideas on phenomenology. Primarily concerned with the philosophy of philosophy, and the analysis of contemporary versions of phenomenology and Marxism, the author contributes penetrating and profound insights on other fundamental philosophical topics such as the nature of value, of essences, of structure, and of possibility and potentiality.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

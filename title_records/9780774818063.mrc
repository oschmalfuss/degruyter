Governments struggle more than ever to govern populations and manage cross-border traffic without building new barriers to trade and commerce. What does citizenship mean in this context? Is it in crisis? Kim Rygiel explores these questions by examining border and detention policies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia as part of a larger politics of citizenship that preceded 9/11. Building on Foucault's concept of biopolitics, she argues that citizenship is becoming a globalizing regime to govern mobility as nations harmonize border and detention policies, outsource state functions to international organizations and private companies, and rely on technologies of governing to discipline the body. The new mobility regime is not only deepening boundaries based on race, class, and gender, it is causing Western nations to embrace a more technocratic, depoliticized understanding of citizenship.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

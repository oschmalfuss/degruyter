Shareholders, employees, and longtime customers all experience firsthand the disastrous effects poor leadership can have on the human side of the business equation.Leadership in the Eye of the Storm is a practical and inspirational guide that helps professionals create opportunity out of chaos. The book's insights are gleaned from the real life experiences of four North American profiled leaders who successfully navigated through the epicenter of their own storms by focusing first on the needs of their employees and families, and then the needs of their organizations. Events discussed include the 9/11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and the SARS outbreak. Tibbo offers a framework emerging from these narratives that enable future leaders to identify and cultivate the skills and behaviours required to not only meet the challenges but seize the opportunities that arise in times of chaos.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

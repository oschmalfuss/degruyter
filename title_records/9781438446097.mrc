During this period changes in the political, demographic, regulatory, and technological landscape created an opportunity for political parties to increase their relevance in the electoral system. In Back in the Game, Brian J. Brox argues that while political parties still provide services to candidates, as they did in the 1970s and 1980s, they have now become influential and independent campaigners in their own right. In addition to providing services, parties now work with candidates as true partners, and increasingly parties act independently of their candidates to pursue collective party goals. Drawing on sources such as interviews with top party staffers and Federal Election Commission data, Brox carefully reveals how modern parties choose among races in an effort to allocate resources in a way that satisfies individual candidates, while simultaneously advancing broader party goals.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

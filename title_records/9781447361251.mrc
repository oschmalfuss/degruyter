This accessible, yet authoritative book dispels this myth of COVID-19 as an 'equal opportunity' disease, by showing how the pandemic is a syndemic of disease and inequality. Drawing on international data and accounts, it argues that the pandemic is unequal in three ways: it has killed unequally, been experienced unequally and will impoverish unequally. These inequalities are a political choice: with governments effectively choosing who lives and who dies, we need to learn from COVID-19 quickly to prevent growing inequality and to reduce health inequalities in the future. COVID-19 is an unequal pandemic.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

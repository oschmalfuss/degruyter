It argues that in their subordinate positions, and within their various capacities – nursing assistants, nursing orderlies, medics and qualified nurses - African women and men played a pivotal role in the provision of healthcare services to their fellow Africans. They transformed hospital spaces into their own, reshaped and reformulated indigenous as well as western nursing and biomedical practices. Through their work, African nurses contributed to the development of the nation by being at the bedside, healing the sick and nursing the infirm.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

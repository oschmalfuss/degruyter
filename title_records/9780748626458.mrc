Part One is a brief introduction to the topics that make up Computer Science, some of which you would expect to find as course modules in a Computer Science programme. These descriptions should help you to tell the difference between Computer Science as taught in different departments and so help you to choose a course that best suits you.Part Two builds on what you have learned about the nature of Computer Science by giving you guidance in choosing universities and making your applications to them. Then Part Three gives you some advice on what to do once you get to university, how to get the most out of studying your Computer Science degree. The principal objective of the book is to produce happy students, students who know what they are letting themselves in for when they start a Computer Science course, and hence find themselves very well suited for the course they choose.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

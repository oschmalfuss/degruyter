This intellectual transformation is sometimes called the beginning of philosophy. And it occurred – independently it seems - in both India and Greece, but not in the vast Persian Empire that divided them. How was this possible? This is a puzzle that has never been solved. This book brings together Hellenists and Indologists representing a variety of perspectives on the similarities and differences between the two cultures, and on how to explain them. It offers a collaborative contribution to the burgeoning interest in the Axial Age and will be of interest to anyone intrigued by the big questions inspired by the ancient world.Key features:Brings together two supremely sophisticated ancient cultures that, despite their similarity, are almost always studied separatelyIndicates the kind of collaboration between specialists that is needed to move forward the stalled debate on the Axial AgeContributors include Paolo Magnone, Joanna Jurewicz, John Bussanich and Jens Schlieter  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

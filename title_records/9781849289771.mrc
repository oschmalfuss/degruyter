This adapted version of CBSD for the Fundamentals Series explores the characteristics of IT-driven business services, their requirements and how to gather the right requirements to improve the service lifecycle throughout design, development and maintenance until decommissioning. By understanding IT-driven business services and anchoring them in a service design statement (SDS), you will be able to accelerate the translation of the needs of the business to the delivery of IT-intensive business services. Product overview CBSD supports portfolio, programme and project management by identifying key questions and structuring the creative process of designing services. Insight into the CBSD approach to deriving an SDS is therefore a practical and powerful tool to help you: Promote a coherent design so that fundamental issues and requirements of needs are mapped, based on different perspectives between demand and supply; Gain insight into the dynamics between stakeholders within an enterprise; Reflect on and formulate a practical and realistic roadmap; and Guide the development, build, programme management and maintenance of IT-driven business services. CBSD complements existing frameworks such as TOGAF®, IT4IT, BiSL® Next and ITIL® by focusing on business architecture, a subject rarely discussed before designing an IT-intensive, complex business service. Who should read this book This book is intended for anyone responsible for designing and implementing IT-driven services or involved in their operation. This includes: Internal and external service providers, such as service managers, contract managers, bid managers, lead architects and requirement analysts; Business, financial, sales, marketing and operations managers who are responsible for output and outcome; Sales and product managers who need to present and improve service offerings; Developers who need to develop new and improved services; Contract managers and those responsible for purchasing; and Consultants, strategists, business managers, business process owners, business architects, business information managers, chief information officers, information systems owners and information architects.

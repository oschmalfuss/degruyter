Multidimensionality of inverse problems has particular value at present, because practice shows that many investigating processes are described by an equation, of which the co-efficient essentially depends on many variables. This monograph is devoted to statements of multidimensional inverse problems, in particular to methods of their investigation. Questions of the uniqueness of solution, solvability and stability are studied. Methods to construct a solution are given and, in certain cases, inversion formulas are given as well. Concrete applications of the theory developed here are also given. Where possible, the author has stopped to consider the method of investigation of the problems, thereby sometimes losing generality and quantity of the problems, which can be examined by such a method. The book should be of interet to researchers in the field of applied mathematics, geophysics and mathematical biology.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

Raising questions of agency, responsibility and culpability in relation to the ‘other’, their cultural representation can enable reflection on and renegotiation of values and collective norms after the destabilisation of war.Through an interdisciplinary lens, this collection analyses the depiction of these transgressive figures in a variety of visual media, as well as the narrative, socio-cultural, political and historical contexts in which they emerge.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

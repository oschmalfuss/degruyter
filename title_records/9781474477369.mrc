The first monograph-length study on the Otago gold rushes and their place in the histories of British and Irish migration, it increases our understanding of the British World by grounding transnational networks in the local ecologies, geologies and weather patterns which shaped local social structures and profoundly affected migrants’ relationships to loved ones in Britain, Ireland and elsewhere.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

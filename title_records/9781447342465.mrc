This book, written by experienced social workers, provides guidance on best practice in a readable and jargon-free style. Working with dementia: · looks at medical, social and citizenship approaches, thus providing the very latest thinking in the field; · covers a wide range of issues, including often-neglected areas such as sexuality and the design of the built environment; · provides contextual information about the old and new cultures of care; and · discusses skills such as communication and practical assistance. This book is essential reading for social work and social care students, social workers undertaking CPD, and social and care workers transferring to dementia care from other fields. BASW/Policy Press series The BASW/Policy Press partnership provides the very best in accessible and practical high-quality resources for social work professionals and students.

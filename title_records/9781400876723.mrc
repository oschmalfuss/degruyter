World War I was ended, and the victory belonged to the democratic states. Theirs was the sober task-and the unique opportunity-of formulating a settlement that would guarantee impartial justice and preserve the peace. Dr. Tillman examines here the documentary account of Anglo-American diplomatic relations during this critical period. He shows the interaction of personalities in both governments, the patterns of cooperation and conflict as they negotiated major issues of war and of peace, and the political repercussions in both England and America that led either to compromise or to defeat of some of the best purposes of the Versailles Treaty.Originally published in 1961.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

A Reader's Guide to Nabokov's "Lolita" carries readers through the intricacies of Nabokov's work and helps them achieve a better understanding of his rich artistic design. The book opens with a detailed chronology of Nabokov's life and literary career. Chapters include an analysis of the novel, a discussion of its precursors in Nabokov's work and in world literature, an essay on the character of Dolly Haze (Humbert's "Lolita"), and a commentary on the critical and cultural afterlife of the novel. The volume concludes with an annotated bibliography of selected critical reading. The guide should prove illuminating both for first-time readers of Lolita and for experienced re-readers of Nabokov's classic work.  afunded by National Endowment for the Humanities and The Andrew W.

While most organisations believe they are prepared for disruption, COVID-19 has proved otherwise. The need for business continuity has never been clearer. If you were hit by a cyber attack and lost the use of your IT systems, would you be able to carry on? If your business premises were forced to close, what would you do? If you were affected by unexpected staff absence, how could you reassure your customers that you can still offer them the service they expect? Being unprepared can lead to financial and reputational damage, which could prove disastrous. You could fail to keep up with customer demand or lose important business, or your customers could go elsewhere. Without a proper risk assessment strategy, your company directors could even face prosecution if a major incident occurs and results in loss or injury. An introduction to ISO 22301 To minimise the impact of a disaster on your business, and to continue to provide essential services to your customers, you need to put in place a BCMS (business continuity management system). This pocket guide will help you understand the basics of business continuity and ISO 22301:2019, the international standard that describes the specification for a BCMS. It covers: What business continuity is; Key terms and definitions; A brief history of business continuity management; The BCMS; ISO 22301 BCMS requirements; and Certification ISO 22301:2019 - An introduction to a business continuity management system (BCMS) provides an easy-to-read and straightforward introduction to a BCMS that business continuity managers, compliance managers, C-suites and disaster recovery planners – or any organisation implementing, or considering implementing, an ISO 22301 BCMS – will find valuable.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

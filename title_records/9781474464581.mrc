No celebrant of the London world can ignore his book.'Peter Ackroyd, from the ForewordIn 1762 James Boswell, then twenty-two years old, left Edinburgh for London. The famous Journal he kept during the next nine months is an intimate account of his encounters with the high-life and the low-life in London. Frank and confessional as a personal portrait of the young Boswell, the Journal is also revealing as a vivid portrayal of life in eighteenth-century London. This new edition includes a Foreword by Peter Ackroyd, which discusses Boswell's life and achievement.Key FeaturesFeatures a new Foreword by Peter Ackroyd, author of London: The BiographyThis edition of Boswell's classic text has long been recognised as THE authoritative versionEdited by the renowned Boswell expert, the late Frederick A.

Rensselaer Lee and Artyom Lukin explore the history, economics, and politics of the RFE in the context of its geopolitical significance both regionally and internationally. Lee and Lukin address questions that have become increasingly important in current global politics: What are the implications, for example, of Russia's growing economic dependence on China? Could the emerging Sino-Russian entente result in the RFE becoming a de facto appendage of the PRC? To what extent is Moscow willing, or able, to strengthen its links to its neighbors other than China? Can Russia and the US act in partnership to further their common interests in the region? As they suggest answers, the authors shed much-needed light on a previously understudied topic.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

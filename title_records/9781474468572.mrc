M. Gordon in the course of his careerW. M. Gordon, who retired from the Douglas Chair of Civil Law at the University of Glasgow in 1999, is well known for his distinguished contribution to Roman law, legal history and land law. He is the author of several books in these subject areas, but it is a mark of his international eminence that much of his prolific output has been published in a wide variety of journals and essay collections outside, as well as within, the UK. This important collection draws together in an accessible format much of his most important writing and, as such, will be in indispensable purchase for all those interested in these core areas of legal scholarship.This important collection draws together much of Gordon's most important writing and, as such, will be in indispensable purchase for all those interested in these core areas of legal scholarship.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Currie was a major economic advisor to president Franklin D. Roosevelt, and as his administrative assistant from 1939 until the president's death in 1945 helped shape Roosevelt's thinking on economic issues.His involvement in U.S. policymaking in China, where he directed Lend-Lease operations from 1941-1943, was one of the factors leading to his confrontation with Senator Joseph McCarthy. In 1949 he directed the first World Bank mission to Colombia.Roger Sandilands had access to Currie's own papers and to previously unpublished material. In this biography he provides the reader with a critical evaluation of Currie's contribution to the literature on the theory and practice of economic development in general, together with an analysis of how his concepts were shaped during the New Deal and in post-World War II Colombia.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 12.

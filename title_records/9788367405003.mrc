For the research about and exploration of the ocean, without modern equipment, we can only look at the ocean and sigh with disappointment. The development of marine science depends largely on equipment and technology. As an important platform for exploration and research, research vessels play an irreplaceable role in the comprehensive research and study about the ocean. Since we entered the 21st century, many major maritime powers start to build a new generation of research vessels so as to meet the improving requirements of scientific research about the oceans.Since 2004, China started to design and build a new generation of research vessels, and after 10 years, we built Kexue, a world- class comprehensive research vessel. The birth of Kexue provides China with the capacity to explore the deep ocean and makes China one of the countries that lead the research and exploration of the ocean.

The topics examined are the image of the half-man, the operation of analogical classification, and ideas about sovereign powers to which men conceive themselves as subject. In each case, analysis brings out remarkable uniformities on a global scale. These cultural similarities are not correlated with particular social forms or linguistic traditions, and in their characteristics features they are not the products of deliberate cogitation or creative invention. The formal attributes they share are that they are premised on binary opposition and symmetry. The argument is that, intrinsically, the social facts in question are spontaneous products of unconscious ‘cerebrational vectors,’ and that they are archetypes of human experience.The three studies included in the volume, originally delivered as lectures at the University of Toronto in 1978, form an important sequel to Needham’s previous book, Primordial Characters, and further develop certain of its analytical themes and substantive issues.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

What hope is there of change? Using an up-to-date account of life in East London, the authors illustrate how cities faced with neighbourhoods in decline are changing. East Enders: · gives a bird's eye view of neighbourhood problems and assets; · provides policy recommendations based on real life experiences; · tackles topical issues such as race relations, mothers and work, urban revival and social disorder through the eyes of families; · is authored by leading experts in community studies. Undergraduate and postgraduate students in social policy, sociology, anthropology, urban studies, child development, geography, housing and public administration should all read this book. Policy makers in national and local government, practitioners and community workers in towns and cities and general readers interested in the life and history of urban neighbourhoods will also find this book an invaluable source of information.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

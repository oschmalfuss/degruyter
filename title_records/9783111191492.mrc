Many of these competencies were unintentionally addressed in other resources in a dispersed way across chapters in various textbooks and internet resources, but many others were not. The book also provides a brief overview of the tasks that various chemical laboratory technicians must perform as part of their employment. It also includes a thorough explanation of the sampling techniques, chemical analysis, and a description of the various tools and methods used in chemical labs. Additionally the book covers information management systems and good practices in laboratories, as well as how these have allowed and facilitated best practices in laboratories and the gathering of data that improves technicians’ experience and knowledge. Finally, some advice on using lab glassware, laboratory emergency first aid, and a short description of the chemicals that chemical technicians frequently use are provided.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

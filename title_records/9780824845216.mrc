As Ronald G. Knapp has shown in earlier studies of Chinese vernacular architecture, the spaces and structures that comprise dwellings throughout China are replete with striking meanings, echoing the most fundamental aspects of Chinese culture. China's Living Houses is the first book in any language to explore comprehensively the extraordinarily complex links among folk beliefs and household ornamentation across time, space, and social class. Well-written and copiously illustrated, it reveals dwellings as dynamic entities that express the vitality of Chinese families as each journeys through life.Part One, "In Quest of Spatial Harmony," explores the ways in which Chinese families structure their dwellings as templates for guiding social behavior and asserting hierarchical distinctions. This section also examines how households go about choosing auspicious building sites through the application of fengshui. Once a house is built, the inhabitants use pictorial and calligraphic charms to guard it against calamities and misfortune.Part Two, "In Pursuit of Good Fortune," reveals the purposeful efforts Chinese make to ensure their share of fu--"good fortune," or "happiness." Fu incorporates a constellation of meanings that bring good fortune to the family and includes five basic components: longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, and a natural death in old age. Layers of meaning are communicated in numerous places within Chinese houses through an astonishing array of ornamentation that employs visual metaphors and punning language. Auspicious woodblock prints, paper cutouts, calligraphic scripts, among many other forms, appear each New Year and are sometimes restored as the year progresses.China's Living Houses includes traditional and modern drawings and photographs taken by the author throughout China over the past thirty years. Specialists and students of China in many disciplines will appreciate the author's wide-ranging approach that relates symbols and folklore to their use in daily life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 03.

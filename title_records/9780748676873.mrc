It also illustrates how his thought has been used in the political sphere and examines the importance of his work for politics today. One of the most prominent theorists in the contemporary humanities and social sciences, Foucault is known as a radical thinker who disturbs our understanding of society. He also presented a moving target, continually changing his concerns and his apparent position. So, until now, comparatively little attention has been given to his politics. Key Features Engages with Foucault's entire corpus, from his first works right up to his posthumously published Collège de France lectures and the unabridged version of the History of Madness Looks at the theoretical reception of Foucault's thought and how it has been applied to real-world problems Student-friendly text boxes highlight and explain key ideasFind Out MoreRead and download the introduction for free (pdf)"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

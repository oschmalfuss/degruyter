In its 2015 edition it comprises some 58,000 titles, from approx. 800 publishers and distributors: publications from a vast range of fields, such as bibliographies and encyclopedias, philosophical, historical, mathematical and physical treatises as well as all facets of literature. The Guide to Reprints provides bibliographical details regarding author/editor, title, ISBN and retail price, the number of pages, illustrations, preface and afterword as well as works bound within the same volume. To meet the changing needs of readers, this bibliography now extends its scope to include titles which are obtainable exclusively as (re)print-on-demand. The Author Title list is structured alphabetically by title, author and editor. Full entries are to be found under the respective title. Cross-references to the main entry are given under author and editor. The Subject Guide divides works into over 200 subject groups, facilitating targeted searches by the subject fields. The Index of Persons as Subject provides fast and reliable access to reprints focussing on specific individuals and their work. An index of publishers and distributors worldwide lists all relevant information. The eBookPLUS format comprises the content and search criteria of the printed edition and its indices, facilitating complex searches.   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

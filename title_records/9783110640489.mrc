Are incubators instrumental in providing an effective platform for accelerating the growth of start-ups? Do the existing incubators meet the expectations of start-ups? Are incubated start-ups able to attract funding from venture capitalists? These are only some of the questions that fall within the scope of this research. In this book, the authors explore the subject in-depth in an attempt to respond to them. For the purpose of this study, primary and secondary research data were used. In the context of American, European and Chinese incubator industries, this data was readily available. However, due to its nascent stage, there was not enough secondary data available in the context of the Indian incubation industry. Therefore, primary research was carried out. Thus, in order to design the research, structured interviews with the founders of start-ups and incubator managers were conducted. The findings of the study reveal that, despite the gaps between the offering of incubators and the expectations of start-ups, there is a positive impact of business incubators on job creation, wealth generation and the creation of intellectual property.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

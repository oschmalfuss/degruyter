Sunbelt Working Mothers compares the experiences of Mexican–American and white mothers employed in apparel and electronics factories in Albuquerque and illuminates the ways in which individual women manage the competing demands of two roles. Authors Lamphere, Zavella, Gonzales, and Evans show how these mothers-without the economic resources of highly paid professional women-find day care, divide economic contributions and household responsibilities with spouses or roommates, and obtain emotional support from kin or friends.After an overview of the recent industrialization of the Sunbelt economy, the authors consider how new participative management techniques have given greater flexibility to some women's work lives. Drawing on interviews with married couples and single mothers, they offer an engaging account of representative women's home lives, and conclude that working families are changing. This timely book will be welcomed by students and scholars in the fields of anthropology, sociology, labor studies, women's studies, and social history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

He shows that madrasa are a living, changing entity, and the site of contestation between groups with varying agendas, goals and notions of modernity.Reading this unique and engaging introduction will provide readers with a clear grasp of the history, place and function of the madrasa in today’s Muslim world (religious, cultural and political). It will also investigate the ambiguity underlying the charge that the madrasa is at heart a geopolitical institution.Key Features:Structured clearly around the role and function of the madrasa in the past and the presentInfuses history, tradition and everyday practice with concrete examples of how the institutions functionProvides a view of the madrasa from within – the author studied in leading Indian madrasas for 6 yearsTreats madrasas worldwide, with a special focus on those in South AsiaIncludes a glossary of key non-English terms used in the book  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Designed for students, scholars, and activists world-wide, this is the first sole-authored book to comprehensively explain the CC approach to scholarship, teaching and mentorship, and prison and criminal justice activism. It reviews the history and scholarship on this engaging field and the challenges that the approach has encountered. It features: • exhibit boxes; • end-of-chapter keywords; • test questions - including multiple choice, short answer and essay format.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

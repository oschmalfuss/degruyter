It is an account of neighbourhood decline, a portrait of conditions in the most disadvantaged areas and an up-to-date analysis of the impact of the government's neighbourhood renewal policies. The book: · explores twelve of the most disadvantaged areas in England and Wales, from Newcastle in the north to Thanet in the south, providing the reader with a unique journey around the country's poverty map; · combines evidence from neighbourhood statistics, photographs and the accounts of local people with analysis of broader social and economic trends; · assesses the effect of government policies since 1997 and considers future prospects for reducing inequalities.

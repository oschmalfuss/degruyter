In this ambitious new study, Malini Guha draws together these two distinctly different ways of thinking about the cinema, interrogating representations of global London and Paris as migrant cinematic cities, featuring the arrival, settlement and departure of migrant figures from the decline of imperial rule to the global present.Drawing on a range of case studies from contemporary cinema, including the films of Michael Haneke, Claire Denis, Horace Ové and Stephen Frears, Guha also considers their world cinema status in light of their reconfiguration of established forms of filmmaking, from modernism to social realism. An illuminating analysis of London and Paris in world cinema from the vantage point of migrant mobilities, From Empire to the World explores the ramifications of this historical shift towards the global, one that pertains in equal measure to cityscapes, their representation as world cinema texts, and to the rise of ‘world cinema’ discourse within film studies itself.Key FeaturesDevelops innovative conceptual tools for understanding and analyzing the depiction of space in the cinemaDraws insights from the field of cultural geography in order to produce an interdisciplinary study of migration as featured in filmOffers new ways of thinking about cities in the cinema while also revisiting older images and tropes associated with the urban experience, including streetwalking and other forms of urban mobility  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

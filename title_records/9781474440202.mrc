Although she made only four films — A New Leaf (1971), The Heartbreak Kid (1972), Mikey and Nicky (1976) and Ishtar (1987) — and never reached the level of acclaim of her frequent collaborator Mike Nichols, May’s work is as enigmatic, sophisticated and unceasingly fascinating as her own complicated, reluctant star persona. This collection focuses both on the films she has directed, and also emphasises her work with other high profile collaborators such as John Cassavetes, Warren Beatty and Otto Preminger.Case studies A New Leaf (Elaine May, 1971)The Heartbreak Kid (Elaine May, 1972)Mikey and Nicky (Elaine May, 1976)Ishtar (Elaine May, 1987)American Masters: Mike Nichols (Elaine May, 2016)Such Good Friends (Otto Preminger, 1971)The Birdcage (Mike Nichols, 1996) Primary Colors (Mike Nichols, 1998)ContributorsClem Bastow, University of MelbourneDean Brandum, independent researcherJeremy Carr, Arizona State University Samm Deighan, Associate Editor of Diabolique Magazine Mark Freeman, Swinburne UniversityAllie Hagan, screenwriter Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, film critic Paul Jeffery, independent researcher Tim O'Farrell, Victorian College of the ArtsMaya Montañez Smukler, New School, Otis College of Art and Design, the New York Film Academy and UCLAJake Wilson, freelance writer and film reviewer  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

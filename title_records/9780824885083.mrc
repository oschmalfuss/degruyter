Born of Yankee ancestry on the New York frontier, he came to Hawaii in 1828 as a missionary physician. In 1842 he left the mission and entered the Hawaiian government. Holding various offices, he was in fact prime minister of Hawaii for almost twelve years of storm and crisis during which time the Islands became enmeshed in the rival expansionist ambitions of England, France, and the United States. In 1849-1850, accompanied by two Hawaiian princes, he undertook a diplomatic journey to London, Paris, and Washington, during which he encountered such figures as Lord Palmerston, Prince Albert, Louis Napoleon, and Zachary Taylor. After he left office in 1853 he was instrumental in developing Hawaii's sugar industry and in exploiting the profitable guano islands to the south.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

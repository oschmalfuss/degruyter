Voices Raised in Protest examines the meaning and impact of these actions and how they diverged in Canada and the United States. Many North Americans opposed their governments' wartime policies toward their fellow citizens of Japanese extraction. In this timely book, Stephanie Bangarth studies the efforts and discourse of anti-internment advocates, and discusses the various cases they brought before the courts. Persons of Japanese ancestry were also active in their own defence. Their critiques of the removal and deportation policies were seminal examples of a growing general interest in civil rights, and would provide a foundation for rights activism in subsequent years. Voices Raised in Protest offers valuable perspective for today's debates over ethnic and racial profiling, treatment of "enemy combatants," and tensions between civil-liberty and security imperatives. It will be of interest to activists and general readers as well as to scholars and students in history, law, politics, and Asian Canadian/American studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

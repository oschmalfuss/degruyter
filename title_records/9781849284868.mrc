There is a common misconception, however, that KPIs are simple measurements that are easy to create, and that the mere act of this measurement will cause people to change their behaviour and improve their performance without additional intervention. Learn to implement an ITSM KPI management system Integrated Measurement – KPIs and Metrics for ITSM is the third title in a series designed to explain, at an operational level, how to implement new processes within an organisation, and how to facilitate the necessary changes to people's behaviour, in order to make that implementation a success. Real-world KPI experience Through an engaging narrative story, this volume in the series looks at the implementation of a KPI management system. Through the central character, readers witness (and learn from) real-world conversations and situations that are commonplace in an everyday business environment. The characters are fictitious, but the story comes from the author's own experience and real accounts. Each chapter ends with valuable lessons and conclusions drawn from events in the narrative, giving the reader a wealth of real-world, practical advice on what works, what fails, and the common traps and pitfalls to anticipate and avoid during an implementation project. People with little or no ITIL® experience, or even a limited IT background, will find this book interesting, entertaining and, above all, extremely useful in understanding the means to a successful implementation of a KPI management system.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

Throughout the years, the church itself has intensified this problem by restricting the options of women -- excluding them from the most valued roles and positions. In the past, Christian women were obliged to find alternative avenues for the expression of their faith and, as a result, their experience has been unusually rich and varied. This pioneering anthology traces the history of Canadian women in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant traditions from the early days through the 1960s.Seventeen Canadian scholars tell the stories of individuals who have worked in traditional and non-traditional roles, alone and as members of groups, both within and outside church structures. All of the articles present new or little-known material, relating the faith, determination, and inventiveness of women whose experience has so far been overlooked. The volume includes an introductory overview of women's church work as well as a comprehensive bibliography of papers and books published about women in the Christian church in Canada, both in English and French.The incorporation of feminist analysis and an emphasis on gender issues set this collection apart from all other studies of Canadian church history. A unique and valuable book, it not only fills a void in the chronicles of religion, it adds an important new dimension to Canadian history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

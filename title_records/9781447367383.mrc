This book explores the role of government and the state in the contemporary world and, considering a range of theories and evidence, discusses views about government responsibility for social welfare services. Applying political theory to social policy, this book seeks to address a set of key questions: what responsibilities do governments have towards their populations? What ought they do and what not? How can they do things better?  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

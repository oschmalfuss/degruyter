An alphabetical compendium of short but substantial essays about Harvard University--its undergraduate college and nine professional schools--this volume traverses the gamut of Harvardiana from Aab and Admissions to X Cage and Z Closet. In between are some two hundred entries written by three Harvard veterans who bring to the task over 125 years of experience within the university. The entries range from essential facts to no less interesting ephemera, from the Arnold Arboretum designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to the peculiar medical specimens of the Warren Museum; from Arts and Athletics to Towers and Tuition: from the very real environs (Cambridge, Charles River, and Quincy Street) to the Harvard of Hollywood and fiction. Harvard A to Z is a browser's delight, offering readers the chance to dip into the history and lore, the character and culture of America's foremost institution of higher learning.

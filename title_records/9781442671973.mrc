It offers both a concise, convenient record of the year's events and a responsible appraisal of important developments. Compiled by a corps of Canadian scholars and experts, writing under the direction of an outstanding Canadian historian and political commentator, it is authoritative and eminently readable. Its articles can be read consecutively for interest and instruction, or they can be spot read with ease to locate particular information. A superb index greatly enhances the value of this annual, now in its third decade, as the definitive record of Canadian political developments.During 1984 Canada was led by three different prime ministers. Pierre Trudeau announced his resignation on 29 February, ending months of speculation about the possibility that he would lead the Liberal party into one more election. When the convention to select his successor was called, Liberal fortunes began to pick up in the polls; when John Turner was selected Liberal leader, it seemed inevitable that he would move quickly to call an election to take advantage of these gains. He did indeed call an early election, but by the time the vote was held, the polls had shifted again and Brian Mulroney was selected Canada's prime minister, the third prime minister in 1984, but only the fourth in sixteen years.Parliament entered the year wrestling with the problems of economic growth, the federal government deficit, and unemployment. At year end the same problems remained, but legislative action had been taken in a number of important areas of long-standing concern. Perhaps the most significant action in the social policy area was the passage of the Canada Health Act, through which the federal government proposed to end extra-billing by physicians through withholding transfer payments from the provinces that permitted such practices.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

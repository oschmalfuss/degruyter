From the early days of fur and fish, to the present, when a remarkable ninety percent of our gross national product is attributable to exports and imports, Canadians have relied on international trade to bolster our economy. A Trading Nation, Michael Hart's brilliantly crafted overview and analysis of the historical foundations of modern Canadian trade policy, is the first survey to address the history of Canadian commercial policy in over fifty years. Taking the view that to understand the present and better prepare for the future, we must first comprehend the past, Hart skilfully guides readers through more than three centuries of Canadian trade history. His engaging narrative explains how Canadians, who currently enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world, have largely come to accept that a country that derives much of its wealth from international commerce has much to gain from an open, well-ordered international economy. Close attention to trade and related economic policy choices, he argues, is crucial if Canada intends to adapt to the challenges of the new globalized economy. This bold and original study is a tour de force, evocative of Harold Innis's and Donald Creighton's pioneering works in the history of the nation. Hart's experience as an active trade negotiator is reflected throughout this accessible and lively book. A Trading Nation is destined to become a classic of Canadian historical, economic, and political studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

This book offers a fresh and challenging new approach to the voices that the confessional state had no prospect of silencing. It provides case studies of a range of very different but highly articulate dissenters, focusing on their modes of political activism and on the varieties of dissenting response possible, and demonstrating the vitality and integrity of witnesses to a spectrum of post-revolutionary Protestantism. It also seeks, through an exploration of textual culture and poetic texts in particular, to illuminate both the ways in which nonconformists sought to engage with central authorities in Church and State, and the development of nonconformist identities in relation to each other.

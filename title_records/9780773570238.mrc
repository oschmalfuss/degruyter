The Italian understanding of what it means to belong to Canada does not require the abandonment of ethnic identity but instead demonstrates the ways in which layers of identity intersect. Wood introduces the more spatial concept of "relocation" and emphasizes the complex and negotiated nature of immigrant identities. She highlights the immigrants' roles as active participants in the creation of their own local, regional, and national spaces, underlining the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to immigrant history. Highlighting the "marginalized" status of these immigrants - as Southern Europeans, Catholics, and residents of western Canada - Wood brings their voice to the centre and shows them to be agents in the production of their identities.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

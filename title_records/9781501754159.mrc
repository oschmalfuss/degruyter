Vladimir Putin's regime has increasingly been accused of embracing fascism, supposedly evidenced by Russia's annexation of Crimea, its historical revisionism, attacks on liberal democratic values, and its support for far-right movements Europe. But at the same time, Russia has branded itself as the world's preeminent anti-fascist power because of its sacrifices during the Second World War while also emphasizing how opponents to the Soviet Union in Central and Eastern Europe collaborated with Nazi Germany.Laruelle closely analyzes accusations of fascism towards Russia, soberly assessing both their origins and their accuracy. By labeling ideological opponents as fascist, regardless of their actual values or actions, geopolitical rivals are able to frame their own vision of the world and claim the moral hugh ground. Through detailed examinations of the Russian domestic scene and the Kremlin's foreign policy rationales, Laruelle disentangles the rationale, meaning, and validity of accusations of fascism in and around Russia. Is Russia Fascist? shows that that the efforts to label opponents as fascist is ultimately a struggle to define the future of Europe and the place of Russia in it.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

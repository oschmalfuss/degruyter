Frank, V.S. Nersesyants) and offers alternative perspectives on widely known ones (M.A. Bakunin, V.I. Lenin, N.A. Berdyayev, V.S. Solov’ëv, M.K. Mamardashvili) Demonstrates the specific character of the Russian tradition in political philosophy as distinctly European while also consciously different in many respectsUtilises existing translations of primary sources, making a world of thought accessible to those who do not read RussianPolitical philosophy in Russia has always sought, and sometimes found, a middle way between embracing anarchy and searching for authority. Political philosophy in Russia has never before been the subject of a scholarly monograph. While historical factors make this understandable, the topic deserves our attention more than ever, now that Russia, after a short Soviet century, has regained self-assurance as a world power. Its unique historical trajectory, and the specific role of philosophy in it, are of interest to many fields of research and, beyond that, broader audiences. A focus on political philosophy as it existed and exists in Russia despite periods of marginalisation and suppression, allows us to understand its specific character, importance and relevance, and to realise that, in trying to think philosophically, critically, and reflectively about the political reality that shapes them, Russian thinkers are not essentially different from philosophers elsewhere. Hence, many lessons that can be learned from this subject.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

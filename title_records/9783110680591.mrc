Every year, the conference presents issues of new scientific research as well as the companies' needs for creating new organizational solutions. The objective of the conference QPI is to provide a platform for researchers, engineers, academicians as well as industrial professionals from all over the world to present their research results and development activities in production engineering, quality of materials, technology and management. The success and prosperity of the conference is reflected in the high level of the papers received. This year, due to the pandemic, the conference was held in a hybrid mode. Some participants took part in the conference remotely via the MS Teams application, and some participants stationary. This form of conference gives much wider opportunities to reach a wider audience. The scientific committee of the conference, in consultation with the organizers, changes the model of conference organization. Each subsequent conference will be carried out in a hybrid mode. The pandemic situation also affects not only the way the conference is organized, but also the research material presented. Logistic problems related to the interruption of supply chains, a significant increase in electricity carriers, multiple requirements for digital competences and new aspects of occupational safety are a new challenge for scientists and practitioners. This issue was present at the 15 Quality Production Improvement Conference. Subject areas, suitable for publication, include the following fields: quality of construction materials and products, industry 4.0, quality management systems, products quality control, visual control and visual management systems, maintenance management, methods of business management/production/quality (Lean, Six Sigma), organization and management of production, manufacturing system design, improving value streams, cleaner production and sustainable development, integrated product development, impact of the pandemic on the safety and efficiency of production systems human resource management vs quality improvement. 2019 Edition PDF ISBN: 978-3-11-068059-1 In thematic sessions, speakers from various research centers presented 28 papers. Manuscripts were received online and initially evaluated by the Scientific committee to ascertain if they fit within the conference topics. Then all accepted manuscripts were blind-peer-reviewed. At the end, the authors were informed about their papers' acceptance or necessary revisions, (papers could be accepted as they were submitted, accepted with minor or major revisions, rejected). The evaluation process takes into consideration both the scientific content and the topics addressed, which have to fit the Conference framework. Technical editors were supposed to ensure that the accepted papers were accurate and easily readable and that they respected the editorial and publishing standards.

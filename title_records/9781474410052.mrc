This book of essays from established and emerging scholars examines the impact since 1600 of out migration from Scotland on the homeland, the migrants and the destinations in which they settled, and their descendants and ‘affinity’ Scots. It does so through a focus on the under-researched themes of slavery, cross-cultural encounters, economics, war, tourism, and the modern diaspora since 1945. It spans diverse destinations including Europe, the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Hong Kong, Guyana and the British World more broadly. A key objective is to consider whether the Scottish factor mattered.ContributorsStuart Allan is Principal Curator of Scottish Late Modern Collections in the Department of Scottish History and Archaeology, National Museums Scotland.David Alston is an independent researcher.Ann Curthoys is an honorary professor at the University of Sydney.Colin G.

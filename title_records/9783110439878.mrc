These models are grounded to a considerable extent in the Transaction Cost Theory and the Resource-Based View as explained and illustrated in the book. Relevant market entry strategies, such as franchising, contract manufacturing, joint ventures, and others are explained and categorized in light of crucial determinants of international business decision making: hierarchical control of operations, the firm’s proximity to the foreign market, the investment risk, and the factor of time. What makes this textbook novel and unique? Its framework combines theories and market entry strategies: each topicis applied to authoritative, real-life business case studies. Complex issues are explained in a manner that results in understanding. Various illustrations and tables help the reader comprehend the point being discussed. The case study focus on Asian firms delivers interesting insights into modern high-technology industries and changing global business dynamics. Market Entry Strategies serves as a vital source for internationally oriented bachelor, master, and MBA programs with strategy, marketing, and management lecture modules. Consequently, this publication is highly recommended for students and scholars; but it is also useful for business practitioners seeking to gain competitive advantages in international business.

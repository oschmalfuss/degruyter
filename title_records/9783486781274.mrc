However, in the 2013 conference, we were overwhelmed with a large number of teachers who not only wanted to find out about this teaching and learning concept but had already used it. Consequently, the focus of the 2nd German Inverted Classroom Conference to which this conference volume is dedicated was no longer the “installation” of the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) but fine adjustments in the actual application of it. This is reflected in the contributions to this volume. Even though all three central aspects of the ICM are addressed, (1) content production and delivery, (2) testing, and (3) the in-class phase, there has been a shift away from mere content production towards an expansion of the model as well as a move towards fine adjustments of the three components.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

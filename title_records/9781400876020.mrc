Little has been known or written about the activities of these parties between 1833 and 1843, when a newly established monarchy under the Bavarian King Otho was attempting to lay the foundations of a new state. It is one of the purposes of this book to locate and classify the parties, to determine their membership, to analyze their institutional structure and societal function, and to discover why their chief identifying characteristic was their foreign orientation. The author seeks to determine the role of the parties under a nonconstitutionalist regime at a time when the basic structure of the Greek state was being created.Originally published in 1968.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

In them he expresses some of his attitudes to the roleo f the university today, its strengths, and its weaknesses. He discusses such matters as the myth of the ivory forever, the effect on the univeristy of the new radicalism and awareness of power on the part of the student; the necessity of maintaining a balance between the demands of undergraduate and graduate studies, between the speecd for professional training, and the study of the humanities, the concept of "double innocence' which has been operative in the administrative framework of Canadian universities and the necessity of change in this framework; what the role of the university should be as patron of and training ground for the arts. Dr. Bissell has firm convictions and high ideals and does not hesitate to make them known to the reader. As a profession of faith from the president of Canada's largest university this is fascinating reading for everyone who is aware of the importance of the university in the world today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

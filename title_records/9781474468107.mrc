The Companion counters this view by showing how liberalism can tackle wide-ranging practical concerns that urgently demand attention in twenty-first century politics. Rather than presenting contemporary liberalism simply and narrowly as a survey of what its main academic protagonists have said over the past 30 years, the guiding principle of the volume is to conceptualise it primarily as a set of themes and approaches informed by the challenges to the practice of liberal politics.Issues such as human rights, citizenship, nationalism, feminism, international communities, supranational orders, post-communism and ecocentrism take their place alongside the more familiar and well-worked themes of justice and justification as topics for liberal theorising. The reader is vividly shown the ways in which liberalism engages directly with the problems of practical political life today.This wide-ranging account of contemporary liberal thinking places the emphasis on agenda-setting, showing that contemporary liberalism is live - relevant, proactive, continuously engaged and adaptable - and that the problems faced by the liberal order are sufficiently complex and perplexing to demand the serious, rigorous philosophical reflection offered by contemporary liberal political theory.The Companion allows the reader to explore liberalism's contemporary relevance and to look to its likely future developments. With contributors including Will Kymlicka, Michael Freeden, Richard Bellamy, Rex Martin, Margaret Canovan, Diana T. Meyers, and Kate Soper, this large, definitive edition will be a must-buy for all libraries and a key reference tool for all those with an interest in contemporary liberalism.Key FeaturesMajor reference work - the only comprehensive reference work on contemporary liberalismShows how liberalism is relevant to practical issues such as human rights, citizenship, international communities and post-communismLooks to the future development of liberalismContributions from the leading figures in the field of liberalism including Will Kymlicka, Michael Freeden and Rex Martin  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

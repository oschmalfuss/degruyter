As the movement has grown, so has the need to understand how yoga works and its effects on individuals, groups, and school culture. Stories of School Yoga brings together firsthand narratives by teachers and practitioners from diverse settings nationwide to illuminate the multifaceted work, challenges, and benefits of teaching yoga to K−12 students in public schools. The stories here supplement and reframe quantitative research in the field; demonstrate how yoga can mitigate stress and tension, particularly amid an increased focus on standardized curricula and testing; and offer lessons learned and practical insights into planning, implementing, and running these programs. Rich in detail and accessible to nonspecialists, Stories of School Yoga presents helpful resources and a nuanced, on-the-ground look at the yoga-in-schools movement.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

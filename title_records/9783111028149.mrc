The text is easy to read, even where concepts can be complex. The strong theoretical background of the author is well known from other publications. In this book, however, the topics are presented on a level that every engineer and scientist in the chemical industry and process industry should know and can understand. This book would have been very helpful at the beginning of my career to close the addressed gap. Therefore, I can strongly recommend it not only to all students close to their degree, but also to engineers and scientists just starting their industrial career in the related industrial sectors that are subsumed under the term process industry (chemical or petrochemical industry, pharmaceutical industry, food industry, biochemical industry, environmental technology, etc.). The book is like an investment. Doing a better job and getting a better job evaluation might pay for the book …" Prof. Dr.-Ing. Claus Fleischer, Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences Process Engineering is based on almost 30 years of practical experience of the author in process simulation, design and development. The book is a missing link between students and practitioners. The author has coached many graduates in their first months and knows what the typical questions are. Coming from the university, graduates often do not know which relevance their knowledge has and how to apply it in real life, whereas established practitioners often stick to the narrow way of their experience, forgetting that science continuously makes progress. There is a gap to be bridged. From his own professional experience, the author covers many topics of the process engineering business, but three guest contributions are a valuable supplement to the content of the third edition. Already in the 2nd edition, Verena Haas from BASF SE wrote an excellent chapter on dynamic process simulation. For the new 3rd edition, Gökce Adali and Michael Benje added two chapters on digitalization and patents, respectively.

It also introduces the method of criticizing and researching historical evidence. In Vietnam, diplomatics has become a compulsory subject for students of the history faculty, and some universities have provided diplomatics major at higher education. Though historical scholars have been well aware of the importance of diplomatics, materials for studies and research in this scientific field are still limited. For this reason, since 2014, the History researchers of Thủ Dầu Một University, Vietnam, have come up with the idea of writing this book entitled Diplomatics and Vietnamese historical evidence to help the community of lecturers and students at tertiary education to access basic knowledge of diplomatics and an overall description of the system of historical evidence in Vietnam.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

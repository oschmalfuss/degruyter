Placing Shakespeare’s works in the history of pacifist thought, Robert White argues that Shakespeare’s plays consistently challenge appeals to heroism and revenge and reveal the brutal futility of war. White also examines Shakespeare’s interest in the mental states of military officers when their ingrained training is tested in love relationships. In imagery and themes, war infiltrates love, with problematical consequences, reflected in Shakespeare’s comedies, histories and tragedies alike. Challenging a critical orthodoxy that military engagement in war is an inevitable and necessary condition, White draws analogies with the experience of modern warfare, showing the continuing relevance of Shakespeare’s plays which deal with basic issues of war and peace that are still evident.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

This indispensable ‘how-to’ book with exercises and visual aids takes novice and veteran researchers through the practicalities and ethics of applying this approach. Written by experienced teacher Nicole Brown, the book: - outlines the conceptual foundations and historical development of the approach; - redefines photovoice as a research method and as a framework; - explores how photovoice can be used in all stages of research from data collection to dissemination; - provides guidance and food for thought to get researchers started on their project. Each chapter ends with exercises that focus readers' learning and understanding by practically engaging them in the work presented throughout. The examples and visual aids will help them recognise all the details presented and represented in a photograph. For researchers who would like to try their hand at photovoice as a method or as a framework to foster a more participatory approach, this is the ultimate guide to kickstart their project.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

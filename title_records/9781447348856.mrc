This Short Guide offers a uniquely succinct and balanced account of this politically charged subject. It distils both the classic and newer debates together in a clear framework and illustrates them with contemporary examples. Designed to introduce a wide readership to international development, the book: • considers how far the field has been reconfigured over time and to what extent it is likely to change in the future; • reviews contemporary topics including tourism, migration and digital technologies; • includes distinctive international case studies and examples. By providing a succinct evaluation of competing approaches to, and perspectives on, the idea and practice of international development, this book offers students across the social sciences a distinct and invaluable introduction to the field.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

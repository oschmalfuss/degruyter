Dubbing Loy an atavistic vanguardist, this book aligns sacrifice with satire, showing how Loy resists modernist anti-sentimentality by devising a feminist satirical mode in which sardonic aggression generates intimacy and proximity, rather than ironised distance. Loy’s attention to ‘low’ body parts – feet, legs, genitals, bellies, wombs – is illuminated in chapters theorising her engagement with dissident sexualities (queerness, prostitution, women’s pleasure); pictorialpoetic cartographies of desire; and the accursed muse, the unsung counterpart to the poète maudit.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

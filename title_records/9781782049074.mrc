A new breed of professional organisers emerged in the constituencies in the form of full-time party agents, who handled registration, electioneering and the day-to-day political, social and educational work of local parties; they performed a vital role as intermediaries between politics at Westminster and at grass-roots level, bridging the gap between "high" and "low" politics. This book examines the agents not only as political figures, but also as men (and occasionally women) determined to establish their status as professionals. It addresses key questions about the nationalisation of electoral politics in this period, demonstrating the importance of understanding the interactions between the centre and the constituencies, and showing that while the agents' professional networks contributed to a growing uniformity in certain aspects of party organisation, local forces continued to play a vital role in British political life. It also provides a fresh perspective on the evolution of the modern British political system, sheddingnew light on debates about how effectively the Liberal and Conservative parties adapted to the challenges of mass politics after 1885. Dr Kathryn Rix is Assistant Editor of the House of Commons, 1832-1945 project at the History of Parliament.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

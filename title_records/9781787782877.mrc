Also known as ‘CCPA 2.0’, the CPRA enhances privacy protections established by the CCPA and builds on consumer rights. The CPRA effectively replaces the CCPA and will bolster privacy protections for California consumers when it takes effect in 2023. While many elements of the two laws are similar, there are some striking differences that could impact CPRA implementation plans, including: Limiting deletion rights that apply to unstructured data A new right to data minimization with retention requirements related to personal data New definitions and obligations related to cross-context behavioral advertising Amending breach liability to include an email address in combination with a password or security question Establishing a new regulatory enforcement body: the California Privacy Protection Agency Organizations that fail to comply with the CPRA’s requirements will be subject to civil penalties of up to $7,500 and a civil suit that gives every affected consumer the right to seek between $100 and $750 in damages per incident, or actual damages if higher. The law is complex and requires careful reading to understand the actual requirements for organizations – The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) – An implementation and compliance guide is here to help.

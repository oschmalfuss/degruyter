One of the key failures of security change management is that it is perceived as a project instead of a programme , and is therefore mistakenly assumed to have an end. Once more unto the breachexplains why information security is an ongoing process, using the role of project manager on a programme of change to highlight the various incidents and issues that arise on an almost daily basis – and often go unnoticed. A major challenge for the ISM is achieving all-important buy-in from their colleagues. Once more unto the breach explains how to express the importance of the tasks you are undertaking in language that executive management will understand. You’ll also discover the importance of having a camera with you at all times. For too long, security has been seen as more of an inhibitor than an enabler. Once more unto the breach is an invaluable resource that will help you improve this perception, and achieve better overall information protection results as a result.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

It draws upon professional experience of scientific research, survey and management, where the author has studied many important native woodlands in Scotland and beyond. It helps readers understand and value these irreplaceable habitats, at a time when they are required to produce a growing range of services to Scotland’s people, while facing threats from climate change, pests and diseases. Following a contextual introduction and history four chapters deal with individual Scottish native woodland types – pinewoods, oak/ birch woodlands, ash woodlands and wet woodlands, along with minor types such as juniper, hazel, aspen and elm. Three chapters deal with actions for native woodland – conservation management, woodland creation and inter-linkages with plantations. A shorter chapter looks to the future, followed by a comprehensive gazetteer of native woodland sites to visit.Whether a student, a private woodland owner, a professional forester or interested in woodlands as a rambler or amateur naturalist, this attractive book provides the information you need in one convenient volume.Key Features:Covers all major aspects of relevance to Scottish native woodland ecology, conservation and management within a single convenient volumePitched at a technical level to attract those relatively new to the subjectContains illustrated examples of the author’s extensive record of woodland study within Scotland and beyondTimely publication when interest in native woodlands has never been stronger  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

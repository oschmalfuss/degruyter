The book works with the textures, tremors and murmurs of voice felt over ten years of ethnographic and participatory research in Australian schools – from research encounters with students and puppets, to school governance council meetings, to school reform evaluation processes, to students’ political activism. It offers a timely critique of the liberal humanist and late capitalist logics of student voice in educational reform, entwined with an affirmation of other possibilities for transversal pedagogical relations in and beyond institutional sites of education.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Every day, social workers grapple with the impact on people's lives of the social inequalities that shape their health chances and experience. This book examines the relationship between social work and health inequalities in the context of globalisation. Based on the practice expertise and research of social workers from developing and developed countries worldwide and using specific examples, this book: · demonstrates the relevance of health inequalities to social work practice and policy across the lifecourse;  · analyses barriers to good health that result from global social, economic, environmental and political trends; · develops core ideas on how social workers can act to combat negative effects of globalisation by adopting a health inequalities lens. Social work and global health inequalities is a unique snapshot of a new global social work that is responsive to local conditions and circumstances but seeks partners in the international struggle for equity, rights and social justice. This groundbreaking collection is essential reading for social work students, academics and researchers, and for policy makers, managers and social workers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

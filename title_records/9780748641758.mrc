In close readings of contemporary novels by Zakes Mda, Arundhati Roy, Roberto Bolaño, Assia Djebar and Richard Flanagan, he demonstrates the usefulness of fabulation as a critical tool, while exploring the problematic relationship between history and story-telling which all five novelists adopt as a central thematic concern.This is an original and exciting project by a highly respected specialist in the field.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

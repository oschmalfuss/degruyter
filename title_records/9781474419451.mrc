Addressing the politics of representation and authorship both behind and in front of the camera, a range of international scholars now expand the theoretical and practical framework informing the current scholarship on documentary cinema, which has so far neglected questions of gender. Female Authorship and the Documentary Image engages with the relationship between female documentary filmmakers and the documentary image. With a thematic focus on the documentary image directly, within the more traditional arenas of theory and practice and especially within the context of gaze and author theory, the book also considers more philosophical questions of aesthetics, home and identity within the contexts of female subjectivity, globalisation and trauma. The book also includes a dialogue on two key photographers, Hannah Wilke and Jo Spence, as well as an interview with Taiwanese documentary filmmakers Singing Chen and Wuna Wu.ContributorsAnna Backman Rogers, University of GothenburgChris Berry, King’s College LondonElizabeth Coffman, Loyola University ChicagoSharon Daniel, University of California, Santa CruzLisa French, RMIT University Gabrielle McNally, Northern Michigan UniversitySophie Mayer, Author and Journalist Rona Murray, Lancaster University Annelies van Noortwijk, University of Groningen Aparna Sharma, UCLABelinda Smaill, Monash University Erica Stein, Marymount Manhattan CollegeCatherine Summerhayes, Australian National University (ANU) Boel Ulfsdotter, Independent ScholarNakane Wakae, Nagoya University  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Her aim has been to encourage a wider reading of Santayana himself. With this purpose she provides an intimate picture of the man using material from his letters and making reference to his autobiography and other philosophical works; but within the biographical framework she also expounds his thought, endeavouring to show the high quality of her subject's "religion" of the imagination. The result is a firmly handled, quietly mannered exposition of the growth of Santayana's mind as seen in his books and the small events of his life as scholar and thinker. It will be suggestive for the general reader and a helpful introduction for the student.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

It explores interaction in pre- and in-service education programs and analyses the spoken and written interactions of teachers with varying levels of experience who are adopting a range of modes of interaction. Both face-to-face and online modes of computer-mediated communication are explored. In doing so the book provides examples of how data can be approached and used to uncover social-interactional themes and issues, in relation to language teacher education and as a micro-context of social interaction in general.With coverage of both theory and practice, this book is a key resource for educators and postgraduate students in areas such as second language teacher education, TESOL, cross-cultural communication, sociology, philology, as well as discourse analysts.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

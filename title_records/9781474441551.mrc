Yet there exists a body of Muslim institutions in the country – Turkish theology faculties – whose work overcomes ideological divisions. By engaging with Turkish theology in its theological rather than political concerns, this book sheds light on complex Muslim voices in the context of a largely Western and Christian modernity.Featuring the work of Recep Alpyağıl and Şaban Ali Düzgün, this innovative study provides a concise survey of Turkish Muslim positions on religious pluralism and atheism as well as detailed treatments of both critical and appreciative Turkish Muslim perspectives on Western Christianity. The result is a critical reframing of the category of modernity through the responses of Turkish theologians to the Western intellectual tradition.Key features Holistic treatment and analysis of the theological oeuvre of two nationally-known Turkish theologians whose main works are not available in English: Recep Alpyağıl and Şaban Ali DüzgünA concise survey of Turkish Muslim positions on religious pluralism and atheismDetailed treatments of both critical and appreciative Turkish Muslim perspectives on Western ChristianityA critical reframing of the category of modernity through the responses of Turkish theologians to the Western intellectual tradition  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

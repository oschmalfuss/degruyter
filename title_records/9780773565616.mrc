She also examines Japanese forestry and the Japanese paper industry. Logging the Globe provides in-depth analyses of the restructuring of the global division of labour; the effect of Japanese demand for pulp; changes in employment, production, land policies, and markets in northern countries; deforestation; plantation forestry; and the influence of European, North American, and Japanese companies on tropical forests and peoples. Marchak considers whether industrial forestry is sustainable and suggests ways in which global demand for forest products can be met in more efficient and more nearly sustainable ways. Logging the Globe presents a global picture of a critically important environmental and social issue. It will be of great interest to professionals in the industry, policy makers and environmental activists, and those concerned with environmental and social issues.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

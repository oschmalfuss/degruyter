Barker have uniquely qualified the author to revise Barker's classic Ecological Psychology: Concepts and Methods for Studying the Environment of Human Behavior (1968). The author's primary goal has been to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive description of behavior setting theory and method with sufficient detail and illustration to guide new research applications. Barker's presentation of theory and method has been preserved except where changes were required to reflect the advances reported in Barker and Schoggen's Qualities of Community Life (1973). The lengthy report in Ecological Psychology of empirical findings from the study of behavior settings the town of Midwest has been replaced by extensive summaries of the currently available reports of research applications of behavior setting theory. Four new chapters have been added: a chapter be economist Karl A. Fox on the use of behavior settings in social system accounting, an article by Barker on behavior settings that have figured prominently in his career, a chapter that discusses behavior settings in relation to a number of other concepts in social science and the field of environment and behavior, and a final chapter on the need for an eco-behavioral science taken from two papers by Barker.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

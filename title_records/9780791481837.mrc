Goodwin tells the story of a group of students from poor and working-class families who struggle against all odds to graduate from an elite university. The author explores the lived experiences of an engaging group of college students and shares their stories of trials and tribulations, joys and sorrows, and their frustrations and successes. Goodwin shows that even though the affirmative action debate was recently "settled" in the Supreme Court, universities are still left to grapple with defining who is deserving, meritorious, and qualified for admission. This timely story of hope and of students persevering through academic adversity poignantly demonstrates the justice of democratic access to higher education.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

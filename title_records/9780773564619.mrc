Picard applies his theoretical assumptions to a detailed development and analysis of the phonological changes that have taken place between Proto-Algonkian and modern Arapaho. In addition he provides a segment-by-segment derivation of over two hundred lexical items, showing exactly which sound changes have applied in each case. Principles and Methods in Historical Phonology is a valuable addition to historical studies of Algonkian languages and will be of particular interest to Algonkianists as well as linguists in general.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

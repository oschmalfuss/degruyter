The son of a CCF member, Schulz was an early organizer for the Manitoba Federation of Agriculture and later an executive in the Grandview Pool Elevator Association. His compelling memoir offers many humorous and poignant anecdotes but is laced with stories of betrayal. Speaking from his intimate, and frequently controversial, involvement in farm politics during a critical decade for prairie agriculture, Schulz argues that the demise of the family farm has not been merely an inevitable side-effect of technology. Many farm families watched their dreams crumble as expected support from trusted politicians failed to materialize. During these years, numerous family farms faded into history, their memory serving as a quaint reminder of what was once a proud tradition.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

This volume also describes the properties gas streams as they are related to corrosion effects are also presented. The relationship of the properties of gas streams as they affect corrosion such as carburization and metal dusting as well as corrosion in steel and other materials used in refinery technology are also presented and the book summarizes key findings into corrosion processes in gas-processing equipment as well as corrosion in offshore structures. Each book contains references at the end of chapter which include information from the open literature and meeting proceedings to give a picture of where the gas processing technology stands as well as indicate some relatively new technologies that could become important in the future. Also, each book also contains a comprehensive glossary. The books are written in an easy-to-read style and offer a ready-at-hand (one-stop-shopping) guide to the many issues that are related to the engineering aspects of the properties and processing of natural gas as well as the effects of natural gas on various ecosystems as well as to pollutant mitigation and clean-up. The books present an overview, with a considerable degree of detail of the various aspects of natural gas technology. Any chemistry presented in the books is used as a means of explanation of a particular point but is maintained at an elementary level.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

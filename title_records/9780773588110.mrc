Its members are at the top of the legal profession and its reach is global. Clients include major foreign investors requiring advice for entry into Canada, as well as for investments in many other parts of the world. In Stikeman Elliott: The First Fifty Years, Richard Pound recounted how Heward Stikeman and Fraser Elliott developed their small law practice into a national and global organization. Here Pound details the firm's global expansion at a time of worldwide economic uncertainty. Embracing both diversity and corporate social responsibility, the organization's unwavering commitment to client confidentiality, knowledge management, and recruiting and retaining lawyers and staff of the highest quality has helped Stikeman Elliott retain its place as one of the preeminent business law firms in the country. An insightful look at recent innovations put into practice, Stikeman Elliott: New Millennium, New Paradigms offers an insider's view of a firm which has carved out an important role in Canadian legal and business history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

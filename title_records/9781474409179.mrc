But what do we know about the skilled artisans who spent their lives designing and creating the paintings, objects and buildings that are so admired today?This anthology of written sources (dating from the seventh to the twentieth centuries) explores numerous aspects of the crafts of the Middle East from the processing of raw materials to the manufacture of finished artefacts. You will learn about: the legal and ethical dimensions of the arts and crafts, the organisation of labour in urban and rural contexts, the everyday lives of artisans, the gendered dimensions of making things, and the impact of industrialisation upon traditional methods of manufacture. Each chapter begins with an introduction providing a wider context for the primary sources. There are also suggestions for further reading.Key FeaturesProvides a clearly structured means to study descriptions of techniques employed in the arts and crafts and of the lives of artisans (male and female) in the Islamic world from the seventh to the twentieth centuriesThe primary sources address the interests of students in a wide range of disciplines, including art history, archaeology, anthropology, and ethnographyNew translations are presented of significant primary accounts written in Arabic, German, and FrenchIllustrated with maps, plans and images of Islamic arts and crafts  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The author is particularly concerned with clarifying the interrelationships between evolutionary changes in morphology and the classification of this large group of fishes. He starts from the premise that the classification should summarize evolutionary relationships and that major steps in evolution are expressed in modifications of functional systems. In the author’s view, changes in the abilities of fish to maneuver in the water, to obtain food, and to force water over the gills—changes that are reflected in the morphology, particularly of skeletal elements—are among the most important advances that have been made within the teleostean group of fishes. With great skill and insight, Dr. Gosline develops these difficult concepts in the first section of the book.In working out his system of classification of teleosts, presented in the second section, the author’s major effort was placed on clarifying the underlying zoological problems: he views the system primarily as a vehicle for discussing zoological information that suggests relationships between teleostean groups.Any student of zoology—not only ichthyologists—will welcome this original and thoughtful approach to problems of animal classification.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

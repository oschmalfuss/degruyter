Ehud Eiran explains why states launch settlement projects into occupied areas and introduces the international environment as an important enabling variable. By drawing comparisons between three such major projects – Israel in the West Bank and Gaza, Morocco in Western Sahara and Indonesia in East-Timor – Ehud Eiran classifies post-colonial settlement projects as a distinct cluster of cases that warrant a different analytical approach to traditional colonial studies.Built on a careful synthesis of existing principles in international relations theory and empirical research, the book advances a clearly formulated theoretical position on the launch of post-colonial settlement projects. The result yields a number of fresh insights into the relationship between conflict, territory and international norms.Key FeaturesExplains what motivates states to launch post-colonial settlement projects, against international trends and normsAnalyses three major post-colonial settlement projects (Israel, Morocco, Indonesia): one of the first books to place these projects in a comparative perspectiveAlso analyses three cases where states considered settlements but did not launch projects: India in Goa, Libya in Chad and Mauritania in Western SaharaArgues that post-colonial settlement projects should be treated as a distinct category of cases, breaking with current work that views them as traditional colonial projects  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

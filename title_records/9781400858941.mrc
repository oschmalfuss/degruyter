Jefferson compiled the first document, called the Parliamentary Pocket-Book," while he was president of the Senate by virtue of his position as Vice- President of the United States. This informal guide was the basis for the Manual of Parliamentary Practice, which Jefferson completed in its earliest form by 1800 and which he had published in 1801. The Manual was the new nation's first full parliamentary rule book and is American democracy's reliable guide to its English parliamentary tradition. Still cited on the floors of Congress.Originally published in 1988.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

One of the fastest-growing niches is, without a doubt, Islamic finance. Indeed, sustainable finance needs constantly evolving innovations, and this book offers valuable insights into Islamic capital structure and Shari’ah equity screening enriching academic discourse. "In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of a new generation of academics and professionals specializing in various aspects of Islamic finance as knowledge and practice. This has brought about a new dynamism and also further sophistication. This book is one of such contributions, as it develops knowledge which is then transformed into practice whereby practical impact is also achieved. Being an academic book, it provokes readers’ thoughts, offering a critique of the implications of the currently applied Shari’ah screenings methodologies. As a transformative practical piece, by developing an innovative screening ratio, in this book, Dr. Yildirim extends his focus on the risk-sharing based financing hierarchy, covers thoughts and the underlying philosophy, and proposes an Islamic version of a pecking order hierarchy. This framework can be considered the foundation for developing an Islamic capital structure theory. This book will benefit academics, professionals, investors, as well as policymakers working in the Islamic finance industry and would like to explore more." (Professor Dr. Mehmet Asutay, Durham University Business School, UK) "This book offers, for the first time after the inception of Shari’ah screening methodologies, a groundbreaking new stock screening solution that is comprehensible, practical, and foremost entirely derived from the primary sources of Islam (Qur’an and Sunnah). Congratulations to Dr. Ramazan for his outstanding contribution to Islamic finance and capital markets." (Associate Professor Dr. Ahcene Lahsasna) "This excellent book is a must-have for all corporate finance students/researchers interested in the theoretical aspect of capital structure and the religious discussion of Shari’ah equity screening. This book should become a companion to those involved in a quantitative research environment and aim to conduct a comparative analysis; an ideal resource for everyone, from Shari’ah scholars to Islamic finance practitioners and beginners to experts."

Kabir Hassan, University of New Orleans, USA)  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Transmitting stories through cable or couriers remained expensive and often required the cooperation of foreign governments and the American armed forces. Initially, reporters from a neutral America documented the early victories by Nazi Germany and the Soviet invasion of Finland. Not all journalists strived for objectivity. During her time reporting from Ireland, Helen Kirkpatrick remained a fierce critic of this country’s neutrality. Once the United States joined the fight after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, American journalists supported the struggle against the Axis powers, but this volume will show that reporters, even when members of the army sponsored, Stars and Stripes were not mere ciphers of the official line. African American reporters Roi Ottley and Ollie Stewart worked to bolster the morale of Black GIs and they undermine the institutional racism endemic to the American war effort. Women front-line reporters are given their due in this volume examining the struggles to overcome gender bias by examining triumphs of Thérèse Mabel Bonney, Lee Carson, Iris Carpenter, and Anne Stringer.The line between public relations and journalism could be a fine one as reflected by the U.S. Marine Corps creating its own network of Marine correspondents who reported on the Pacific island campaigns and had their work published by American media outlets. Despite the pressures of censorship, the best American reporters strove for accuracy in reporting the facts even when dependent on official communiques issued by the military. Many war-time reporters, even when covering major turning points, sought to embrace a reporting style that recorded the experiences of average soldiers. Often associated with Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin, the embrace of the human-interest story served as one of the enduring legacies of the conflict.Despite the importance of American war reporting in shaping perceptions of the war on the home front as well as shaping the historical narrative of this conflict, this work underscores how there is more to learn. Readers will gain from this work and new appreciation of the contribution of American journalists in writing the first version of history as the global struggle against Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and Fascist Italy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

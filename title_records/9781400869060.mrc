Narrative and pictures follow Shakespeare from his birth and boyhood in Stratford, through his career in the London theatre, and back to Stratford during the last years of his life, in retirement. Included in the 114 illustrations—many of them taken from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century originals—are two authentic portraits of Shakespeare. Pictures of the houses in which he lived, the theatres in which he acted, the other actors with whom he worked, and the faces of many people who knew him and wrote about him—all add a sense of immediacy to the biographical narrative and make Shakespeare come alive within the context of his own age.Originally published in 1967.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

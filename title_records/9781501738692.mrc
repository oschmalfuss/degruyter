The Cold War's end has unleashed nationalist sentiments across Europe and the former Soviet Union. But just what is nationalism, and how will it affect Europe? This accessible book examines where this new wave of nationalism has come from and how best to respond to it.Although it played a central role in the violent breakup of Yugoslavia, nationalism elsewhere has been a key source of both social cohesion and international cooperation. Depending on the trajectory of these competing forces of fragmentation and integration, Europe might be moving toward either decades of ethnic strife and national rivalry or an unprecedented period of peace.This book brings together ten original essays by leading area specialists and political commentators. Some of the chapters explore the intellectual and social roots of nationalism, while others focus on specific nationalist movements-with particular emphasis on the former Yugoslavia and other post-communist countries. A final group of essays assesses policy responses, asking how the international community can help build stable states and tolerant societies in an era of resurgent nationalism.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 05.

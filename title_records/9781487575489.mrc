The London and Middlesex County Councils and many other smaller local authorities were abolished; the boundaries of Essex, Kent and Surrey were redrawn. A new structure was established consisting of a Greater London Council and 32 London Boroughs with a unique division of responsibilities between them. Using much unpublished material Mr Rhodes examines in detail why these changes came about -- changes which produced the first major reform of the local government structure in Britain since it was established in the late nineteenth century. He identifies certain key points in the history of these events: the decision of the Conservative Government to reverse previous policy and set up a far-reaching enquiry into London Government in 1957; the Royal Commission's analysis of the problem and its recommendations; and the Government's decision in 1961 to initiate a scheme of reform based on the Commission's recommendations in spite of the strong opposition this was bound to provoke. Mr Rhodes describes the course of events from 1957 until 1965 when the new system came into operation in Greater London. He analyses the motives of the participants, including the political parties, the local authorities, government departments and professional bodies. Emphasis is laid not only on the political struggle but equally on the practical problems of administration in a metropolitan area which are essential to an understanding of the event. This book is the first comprehensive record and analysis of the events which led to the reforms of 1965.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

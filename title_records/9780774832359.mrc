Instead, it has most often represented the interests of professionals, academics, and governments, while policy makers and researchers frequently overlook or disregard the complexity of issues that fall under this designation. Contesting Elder Abuse and Neglect questions existing understandings about the mistreatment of older people. It explores how and why the designation “elder abuse and neglect” came to be and shows how this term masks problems concerning the mistreatment of older people, their place in society, and how they see themselves. Joan R. Harbison and her colleagues expose how supposed solutions to the problem of abuse can take their toll on those people they were originally intended to protect. The book is an important contribution to the literature that encourages new thinking about issues concerning the mistreatment of older people.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

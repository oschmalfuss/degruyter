The material offers fresh perspectives on the economics and politics of agriculture, the condition of the agricultural labourer, the use of steam power, the land question, education and changing farming practices.Key FeaturesContains significant new material by Jefferies that is republished here for the first time since it appeared in the Victorian periodical pressOffers new material for research in the areas of Victorian literature, the environmental humanities, the history of agriculture and politics, and to those with interests in rural writingContains a number of newly attributed essays and letters  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

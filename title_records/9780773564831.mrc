Although asthma can often be treated successfully, many misconceptions about it persist. In response to requests from patients and health care professionals, Hélène Boutin and Louis-Philippe Boulet have written this practical guide to understanding and controlling asthma. Understand and Control Your Asthma is designed to help asthmatics take control of their health through better understanding of the disease and its treatment and by applying self-management skills to avoid attacks. Topics discussed include the factors that trigger asthma, the different treatments available, effects and side-effects of medications, and what to do if the disease becomes worse. Questionnaires enable asthma sufferers to evaluate their understanding of the concepts presented in the book and develop a personal case history, which will help them to communicate more effectively with physicians about their symptoms. Boutin and Boulet also provide advice on measures that may help asthmatics lead normal and productive lives. Understand and Control Your Asthma is a valuable reference and workbook for asthma sufferers and their families, friends, and colleagues. It will also be of interest to asthma specialists and general practitioners.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

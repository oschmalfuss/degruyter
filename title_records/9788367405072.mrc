Several companies found there's a critical need to redefine the work environment and started exploring the metaverse concept beyond the entertainment sector. Thus, new tools for collaboration and data visualization within a digital shared space are being created, aiming for a fully immersive interaction between the virtual and the physical worlds within the next few years. While still in its early developments, the metaverse can be seen as an extension of the social media platforms, and an opportunity to leverage remote work even further. ICESS 2022 provides a space for all those interested in Economics and Social Sciences to discuss and exchange research ideas in the light of the work environment, business model, and technological changes driven by COVID-19. We welcome both empirical and theoretical work that is broadly consistent with the conference's general theme. The main topics of the conference are focused on, but not limited to, the following sections: Applied Economics and Statistics and Data Science Management in the Metaverse Era - the Role of Digital Transformation in Fostering Recovery of Public and Private Organizations Financial perspectives in turbulent times Resilient Agri-food and Environmental Systems for Sustainable Development and Agile Entrepreneurship Innovative Strategies and Models in Higher Education Digitalization impact on economic recovery in the context of Covid-19 pandemic Digital Leadership and Resilient Entrepreneurship in the Metaverse Era Marketing and Sustainability The role of accounting frameworks and digitalization in fostering recovery Global world after crisis: towards a new economic model Building business in times of crisis through entrepreneurship Current challenges within demographic data: measurement, collection, retrieval, analysis and reporting Looking into the future of a legal metaverse?

It sparked a major controversy among viewers, war veterans, and historians. Brian and Terence McKenna, the authors-producers of the series, were accused of distorting historical facts, maligning individuals such as commanders Arthur Harris and Guy Simonds, presenting a biased account of events, and overstepping the line between journalism and drama. The Valour and the Horror Revisited brings together source documents, original essays, and commentaries to provide an analysis of the specific accusations and of larger questions concerning responsible journalism. Included in the collection are reports by David Bercuson and S.F. Wise, who were asked by the CBC ombudsman to assess the series; the CBC ombudsman's report; the McKennas' response to the ombudsman's report; the ombudsman's commentary on the McKennas' response; and three new essays by historians John Ferris, William McAndrew, and Scot Robertson on the incidents covered in the series - Canadian involvement in the battles in Hong Kong and Normandy, and the bombing of Germany. The Valour and the Horror Revisited addresses such important issues as the dangers of "docudrama," the calibre of the Canadian media, the meaning of the Canadian experience in the war, and the nature of history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

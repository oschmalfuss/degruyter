The collection engages with a wide range of case studies, examples of which include:theatre productions by Forced Entertainment, Daniel Kitson, She Pop, and Agnieszka Piotrowskaart works by Rembrandt, Damien Hirst, Anish Kapoor, and othersinternet works of art by Trecartin and Fitch, Hannah McPherson, as well as examples of ‘live’ networked art productionsfilms by Peter Greenaway, Spike Lee and Pedro Almodóvarphilosophical approaches to theatricality drawing on works by Immanuel Kant, Martin Heidegger, Stanley Cavell and Jacques DerridaTheatricality and the Arts presents a series of investigations of the notion of ‘theatricality’. Primarily, theatricality concerns that which pertains to theatre, but the term has always carried with it the potentially pejorative associations of exaggeration and fakery. The essays here question and contest such associations.The book is divided into four sections which together provide a comprehensive interrogation of theatricality. The four sections begin with multimedia, where theatricality is examined in relation to mixed modes of media (internet art, painting, performance and digital display). A second section takes a philosophical approach to questions of theatricality. A third section looks at art, broadly speaking, but also at the historical contexts of art, photography and other media (literature, film, music). A final section features reflections on theatre and cinema, often in conjunction. Considered as a whole, the collection contributes to debates on theatricality in various fields, while also enabling a cross-examination of approaches to the topic.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

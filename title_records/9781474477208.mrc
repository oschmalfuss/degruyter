This is seen particularly in relation to the disposal of land held on the common good. In recent years, the administration of common good funds and assets has frequently brought local authorities into conflict with community councils.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

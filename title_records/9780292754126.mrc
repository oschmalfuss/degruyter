Delena Tull amply supplies that knowledge in this book, which she has now expanded to more thoroughly address plants found in New Mexico and Arizona, as well as Texas. Extensively illustrated with black-and-white drawings and color photos, this book includes the following special features: Recipes for foods made from edible wild plants Wild teas and spices Wild plant dyes, with instructions for preparing the plants and dying wool, cotton, and other materials Instructions for preparing fibers for use in making baskets, textiles, and paper Information on wild plants used for making rubber, wax, oil, and soap Information on medicinal uses of plants Details on hay fever plants and plants that cause rashes Instructions for distinguishing edible from poisonous berries Detailed information on poisonous plants, including poison ivy, oak, and sumac, as well as herbal treatments for their rashes  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Professor Hurst begins by setting forth some of the potential subject areas for this field, pointing up a wide range of possibilities. He proceeds to outline the development of the characteristic powers, capabilities, and limitations of the major legal agencies whose work furnishes the core of legal history. Next he offers examples from the history of law viewed in relation to other social institutions and to broadly shared values in society, treating first law, science, and technology, and then law's efforts to shape, serve, and adapt to the market and the big business corporations. In "Retrospect," his brief concluding chapter, he summarizes his views on the role and function of legal history.A major synthetic achievement, this book should be of compelling interest to social historians, historians of law, political scientists, and others concerned with the legal dimensions of social history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

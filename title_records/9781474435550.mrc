In doing so, he gives us a new portrait of Hegel’s final system that is surprisingly relevant for our contemporary world, connecting it with recent work in speculative realism and new materialism. Furlotte offers a sophisticated sense of the fundamental materialism permeating Hegel’s concept of freedom and how the former serves as the inescapable precondition of subjectivity and social history. He also reveals how material nature and culture’s reactions to it problematize human freedom – even threaten it with utter annihilation. This book forces us to reconsider accepted accounts of Hegel’s system and to re-evaluate what Hegel, and German Idealism, might still offer us today.Key FeaturesA sophisticated account of the materialism at work in Hegel’s final system and how it is both crucial to, and problematic for, his project of freedomOffers a complex sense of how Hegel and German Idealism try to bridge the gap between material necessity and radical freedom which opened up in the wake of Kant’s ground-breaking CritiquesGives a distinct sense of the rich philosophical potential of Hegel and German Idealism for our contemporary world, particularly in terms of nature, subjectivity and freedom"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

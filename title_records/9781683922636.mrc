It includes questions for discussion and “Cloud Computing Lab Experiments” to help in mastering its complex services and technologies. Recent research shows that cloud computing will be worth billions of dollars in new investments. Organizations are flocking to the cloud services to benefit from the elasticity, self-services, resource abundance, ubiquity, responsiveness, and cost efficiencies that it offers. Many government and private universities have already migrated to the cloud. The next wave in computing technology—expected to usher in a new era—will be based on cloud computing. Features: Explores the basic advancements in the field of cloud computing Offers a practical, self-teaching approach with numerous case studies and lab experiments on installation, evaluation, security, and more Includes material on ESXi, MS AZURE, Eucalyptus, and more.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

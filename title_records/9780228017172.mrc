He traces its history from the roots, when soldiers, settlers, and militia volunteers rallied to defend the southern borders of their adopted country against invasion from the United States. Drawing on diaries, letters, classified documents, and the regimental archive, Jarymowycz weaves the strands of a complex story into an epic narrative of a resolute collective of officers and men.Since its birth in 1862 as the 5th Battalion, Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada, thousands of citizens have served in the unit. In addition to securing Canada’s borders, Black Watch soldiers have fought in the South African War, both world wars, and the Korean War. They have bolstered NATO operations and United Nations peacekeeping missions, and they provided aid to the civil power during the 1997 Quebec and Eastern Ontario ice storm disaster and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Montreal-based battalion continues to serve Canada in its traditional role as a reserve infantry unit, and to this day, Black Watch soldiers frequently deploy on dangerous missions abroad. Volume 3 relates the regiment’s post–Second World War story. Canada’s commitments to NATO and the United Nations led to the creation of two regular battalions of the Black Watch, while retaining the reserve battalion in Montreal. From 1953 to 1970, in Korea, Germany, Cyprus, and Canada, the regular battalions served with devotion and courage. The thousands of men who were based at Camp Aldershot, Nova Scotia, and the Regimental Depot in Sussex, New Brunswick, then moved to establish a Regular Force Home Station in the newly constructed Camp Gagetown, NB. These units earned a reputation second to none in efficiency, training, fighting ability, readiness, and strength. This monumental history of Canada’s oldest Highland regiment is at once a record of Scottish heritage, a portrait of Montreal rising as an industrial giant, and an examination of the emergence of a military culture from the Western Front.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Bernard Frischer focusses on the Epicureans, who are of special interest because their approach was at once extremely passive and extremely successful. Unlike other philosophical schools, which depended primarioly on public lectures and books, the Epicureans avoided contract with the dominant culture and attracted members by erecting statues of Epicurus and their other master in public places. These iconologically rich, ";sculpted words"; appealed to teh very people most likely to be attracted to Epicureanism, those most likely to accept the philosophy of materialism, sensationalism, and the repression of feeling, and those who sought a way of life sperate from teh dominant culture. This book is an innovative application of an inter-disciplinary humanistic an social-scientific approach to ancient Greek philosophy and art. It will appeal to those interested in the history of these subjects and those interested in the sociology of knowledge and communication.

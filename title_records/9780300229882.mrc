According to Banner and Cannon, to be an effective teacher requires much more than technical skill. Great teaching is an art that combines a wide range of intellectual, moral, and emotional components. This classic work explores the qualities of mind and spirit that are essential for those seeking to help others acquire knowledge and understanding. It analyzes the specific qualities of successful teachers: learning, authority, ethics, order, imagination, tenacity, compassion, patience, character, and pleasure. Written in a clear and engaging style and applicable to all levels of teaching—be it in schools and universities or on athletic fields and in the home—the book encourages teachers to consider how they might enlarge their understanding of the great art of teaching.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

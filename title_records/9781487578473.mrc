A brillant satire in dialogue, Le Neveu de Rameau is Diderot’s masterpiece. Subjected to intense critical scrutiny since it first appeared in a German translation by Goethe in 1805, it remains one of the most enigmatic works in French literature. Although it is universally recognized as one of the outstanding literary monuments of the French 18th century, there is no agreement among scholars as to its structure, its literary form, or the author’s meaning in the dialogue. Professor O’Gorman proposes a radical new theory of the overall meaning of the dialogue. His careful analysis of the text traces Diderot’s ideas to sources in ancient literature and discloses several levels of meaning hitherto unsuspected. The discussion of Satire première is supplemented by an annotated critical edition of the work ; the analysis of Lui et moi is supplemented by an annotated text. These are not stylistic studies but literary analyses. Their ai mis to clear up difficulties presented by the text and to provide an explanation and an appreciation of each satire. The method used is mainly historical; with special emphasis being given to the sources of Diderot’s thought. This study opens fresh perspectives on Diderot the man, as well as Diderot the artist, and is an important contribution to scholarship on the Enlightenment. The book contains a Foreword by Professor Otis Fellows of Columbia University, editor of the series Diderot Studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

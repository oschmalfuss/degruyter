You are not alone. For the past ten years, lawyer and Honolulu Advertiser columnist David Larsen has provided sound answers and advice to thousands of people asking such questions as: "What happens if I die without a will?" "Does the State take it all?" "How can I avoid probate?" "Will my kids have to sell the house to pay the inheritance tax?" "Will the State pay for my stay at a nursing home?"Here you will find the answers to these and many other questions in plain, easy-to-understand language. You will not only learn about how the law affects you, but also see what others have done and learn from their mistakes. Often entertaining and always informative, Death and Taxes is your guide to overcoming the nemeses of taxes and probate.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

But why are certain people and places vulnerable? And who is responsible for a remedy? From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Canadian government relocated people, often against their will, in order to improve their lives. Moved by the State offers a completely new interpretation of this undertaking, seeing it as part of a larger project of development and focusing on the bureaucrats and academics who designed, implemented, and monitored the relocations rather than on those who were uprooted. In this finely crafted history, Tina Loo explores the contradiction between intention and consequence as diverse communities across Canada were resettled. In the process, she reveals the optimistic belief underpinning postwar relocations: the power of the interventionist state to do good.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

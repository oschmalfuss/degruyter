If Canada hopes to gain advantage from the dramatic developments underway it will have to aggressively adapt its foreign and domestic policies and priorities under the clear direction of the federal government or accept being left behind. In Brave New Canada, Derek Burney and Fen Hampson identify the key trends that are reshaping the world's geopolitics and economics and discuss the challenges Canada confronts with the rise of China and other global centres of power. Their examination of a wide range of themes - including the place of pluralistic democratic values in diplomacy, economics, and trade, the ways that Canada should reset relations with its neighbour to the south, as well as how to manage new global security threats - paints a picture of how Canada can become bold, assertive, and confident and easily adjust to a new global landscape. Arguing that a successful foreign policy cannot be crafted by looking at the world in the rear-view mirror, Brave New Canada offers evidence-based, provocative prescriptions for both the public and private sectors that should stimulate discussion and command widespread attention.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

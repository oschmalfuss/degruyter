While these questions recur regularly within Western political philosophy, answers to them have often relied on dogmatically held ideals, such as the distinction between truth and doxa or the privilege of thought over sense. In particular, the strain of idealist political philosophy, inaugurated by Plato and finding contemporary expression in the work of Alain Badiou, employs dualities that reduce the complexities of practices of resistance to concepts of commitment.Chris Henry brings together the work of Althusser, Badiou and Deleuze in order to offer a new idea of political practice He develops a structural ontology that gives rise to non-idealist, non-dogmatic, yet ethical practices of resistance against the return of classical ontological dualities.Key FeaturesBrings together the work of Althusser, Badiou and Deleuze in order to offer a new idea of political practiceDevelops a structural ontology that gives rise to non-idealist, non-dogmatic and yet ethical practices of resistance against the return of classical ontological dualitiesContributes to the 'ontological turn', problematising tacit assumptions in the literature such as to be/to not be, the unity of the faculties of understanding, and a formal distinction between epistemology and ontologyClosely reads Badiou's metaphysics and critiques his concepts of two Platonic and one Parmenidean dyadsHighlights the importance of time in Althusser's workReads Deleuze through unlikely, yet important, encounters with Mill and Althusser"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

This book looks at the studios, films and policies that charted the transnational vision of Hong Kong and Taiwan, two places with an uneasy relationship to the idea of nationhood.Examining the cultural, political and industrial overlaps between these cinemas – as well as the areas where they uniquely parallel each other – author Brian Hu brings together perspectives from cinema studies, Chinese studies and Asian American studies to show how culture is produced in the spaces between empires. With case studies of popular stars like Linda Lin Dai and Edison Chen, and spectacular genres like the Shaolin Temple cycle of martial arts films and the romantic melodramas of 1970s Taiwan, this book explores what it meant to be both cosmopolitan and Chinese in the second half of the twentieth century.Key FeaturesStudies Hong Kong and Taiwan cinemas together, and separately from the cinema of mainland ChinaBrings together perspectives from Chinese studies and Asian American studies to show how culture is produced between empires, in ethnic and racialized ways internationallyProvides a serious take on “trashy” work that has been neglected by scholarship, including: romantic melodramas; martial arts films with seemingly recycled plots and tropes; action films; and music videos  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

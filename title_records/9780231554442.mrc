So why do we keep ending up browsing the same old sites and best-seller lists? When sellers don’t offer potential customers a compelling digital experience, consumers miss out on great products—and businesses miss a vital opportunity to grow.Raj K. De Datta, the founder of a company that powers digital-commerce experiences for many of the world’s biggest brands, offers an actionable playbook for companies looking to deliver better digital experiences. His key insight is that exceptional digital experiences are much more than marketplaces. They don’t just serve customers’ transactional needs but rather address the deeper problems for which they seek solutions. They are built on a digital-experience platform that provides agile, personalized, scalable performance. And they are created by product-centric digital teams, not traditional organizations.The Digital Seeker distills key lessons from the compelling stories of innovative businesses: not just tech companies but companies spanning a wide range of industries, including amusement parks, fashion, sports, health care, distribution, and the public sector. De Datta defines and explains the power of the seeker-centric philosophy—translating it into a core operational playbook for digital teams to achieve transformative results.Importantly, this book also offers crucial insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our digital lives and the long-term effects it will have on digital experiences of the future.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

With case studies of films such as The Suspended Step of the Stork (1991), The Way to the West (2003), Man at Sea (2011) and many more, this ground-breaking book provides an in-depth understanding of contemporary Greek cinema and its direct correlation to the country’s ongoing struggles to implement European modernity.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

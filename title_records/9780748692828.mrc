That state was the revolutionary democracy of France. In the intervening period, there has been a remarkable transformation in the way democracy is understood and valued – today, it is the non-democractic states that are seen as rogue regimes. Christopher Hobson looks at the historical contrast between the strongly negative perceptions of democracy in the 18th century and the very high degree of acceptance and legitimacy in contemporary international politics. Building on this, Hobson looks at the role of democracy in international relations: in the past, its present role and the likely future challenges. Key FeaturesTracks the emergence and development of popular sovereignty, democratic government, democratic peace theory and the international system One of the first books to employ a conceptual history approach to international relations and international politics, allowing for a unique perspective for understanding the contemporary challenges and future uncertainties now facing democracyPresents a more cautious approach that avoids the overconfidence of many liberals and the excessive pessimism of many realists  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

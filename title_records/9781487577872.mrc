At his death in 1945, Professor Arthur S. Morton left uncompleted a manuscript of a history of the University; and from his material Dr. Carlyle King has extracted and assembled this book. During the preparation of the manuscript, Professor Morton secured the collaboration of his long-time colleagues in furnishing memoranda about particular aspects of University history, and was in constant communication with Dr. Murray, who provided for his use letters and documents, gave him access to the proceedings of the Board of Governors, and drew upon his personal recollections.Professor Morton’s expressed intention in undertaking the history was to give “a clear exposition of the principles on which the University was founded and by which it has been governed.” As Dr. King points out, this intention is realized within the framework of the present book. In the nineteen-twenties the University entered upon a new period of expanding services, but its development proceeded along lines of administrative and education policy that had been firmly laid down by its founders and early leaders.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Veterans from other states or Canada later settled in Oswego County and made the place their home as well. This book tells the stories of thirty-seven of these soldiers. Some were chosen for their post-war activities, whether it was volunteerism, politics, or profession. Others were selected to demonstrate the high cost of war for survivors who returned to civilian life. Still others, who had re-enlisted for a second tour of duty, made the ultimate sacrifice, leading to far-reaching consequences for those they left behind. Along with the men who served, this book also tells the story of the women who supported them and who were involved in supporting the Union cause. Author Natalie Joy Woodall has conducted extensive research to uncover many previously unknown stories of many of these brave men and gives the precise location for each gravesite.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

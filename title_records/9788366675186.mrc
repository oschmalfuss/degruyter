We are interested in scholarship that crosses disciplinary lines and speaks to readers from a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives. In other words, the ICSSED will be a forum for scholars when they address the wider audiences of our many sub-fields and specialties, rather than the location for the narrower conversations more appropriately conducted within more specialized conferences. We suggest the following broad areas of research: Social Sciences and Laws History and Cultural Studies Interdisciplinary Studies Moral and Humanities Policy, Politics, and Communication Education The proceedings represent the latest in research, development, deployment and projects on a range of topics presented at International Conference of Social Science and Education The papers published under each conference are sorted according to the themes and topics defined under each event. Papers are published according to the events at which they were presented by the authors. They can be searched by theme, author, or title. All the papers published here are open access, thus free of charge. Complete versions of the conference proceedings are also available as PDF to download. All submitted manuscripts are read by the editorial staff. The review proccess uses double blind review system. Those manuscripts evaluated by editors to be inappropriate to criteria are rejected promptly without external review. Manuscripts evaluated to be of potential interest to our readership are sent to reviewers. The editors then make a decision based on the reviewer's recommendation from among several possibilities: rejected, require major revision, need minor revision, or accepted. Ethical Guideline for Publication The publication of an article in prociding (Sciendo)/ICSSED is an essential building block in the development of a coherent and respected network of knowledge. It is a direct reflection of the quality of the work of the authors and the institutions that support them. Peer-reviewed articles support and embody the scientific methods. It is therefore important to agree upon standards of expected ethical behavior for all parties involved in the act of publishing: the author, the editor, the reviewer, the publisher, and the society. As the publisher of Sciendo takes its duties of guardianship over all stages of publishing seriously and it recognizes its ethical and other responsibilities. Faculty of Social Science Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta committed to ensuring that advertising, reprint or other commercial revenue has no impact or influence on editorial decisions. Publication DecisionsThe editors of ICSSED is responsible for deciding which articles submitted to the prociding should be published. The validation of the work in question and its importance to researchers and readers must always drive such decisions. The editors may be guided by the policies of the prosiding's editorial board and constrained by such legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding libel, copyright infringement, and plagiarism. The editors may confer with other editors or reviewers in making their decisions. Plagiarism Screening It is basically author's duty to only submit a manuscript that is free from plagiarism and academically malpractice  aAims and Scope The ICSSED is an academic conference that is centered on social science and education, is open and welcoming to contributions from the many disciplines and approaches that meet at the crossroads that is communication studies.

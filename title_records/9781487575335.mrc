This has arisen more from somewhat ill-informed Press criticism rather than from the British public itself. Britain's error in the Commonwealth seems to have been its natural inclination to be on top which has been difficult to reconcile with its lesser status in world power politics today. However, the necessity of solving world problems on a global rather than a regional scale, could perhaps lead to the strengthening of the Commonwealth and Britain's assumption of a leading role within the Association. This book consists of a collection of essays, originally prepared for a seminar at Marlborough House in May 1969 -- but which has since been revised considerably and brought up-to-date. The contributors are eminent specialists from several Commonwealth countries who discuss the various aspects of the Commonwealth Association from a world-wide viewpoint. They explore the various ways of enhancing internal Commonwealth relations from the point of view of international co-operation, in the fields of trade, capital, manpower resources and administration -- in particular such crucial topics as the effect upon the Commonwealth of Britain's application the join the Common Market, the role of sterling as a world currency and the effect of Soviet sea-power on Britain's decision to sell arms to South Africa. These essays do not set out to solve the Commonwealth problems but offer discussions and ideas in a wide context. Some of these ideas may be used by Government and others may require far deeper investigation. However, the aim is to present a comprehensive and well-informed study of many aspects of the Commonwealth Association in relation to world-wide politics. This book will appeal to all those studying or working in international politics, world relations and current affairs. It is a well presented, detailed and extremely informative survey of the role of the Commonwealth Association in world politics today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

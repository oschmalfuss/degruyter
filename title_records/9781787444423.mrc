As a Lord Lieutenant during the Great War, Hugh Fortescue was a pre-eminent figure in Devon's local elite, to which his involvement with the war effort in the county was significant. This volume considers the wartime experiences of a county's Lord Lieutenant through a presentation ofrecords from Fortescue's private papers. It contains the original typescript that Earl Fortescue wrote in 1924 as a retrospective account of his experiences during the conflict and the diaries that he kept from 1914 to 1918. In particular, the wartime diaries of the fourth Earl Fortescue are a rich, insightful and multifaceted account of Earl Fortescue and the Fortescue family during the war years. Alongside the original typescript and his wartime diaries,this book also presents a selection of documents related to the Great War from the Fortescue family at Castle Hill archive. By presenting these documents from Lord Fortescue, this book raises awareness of his involvement with thewar effort in the county and the momentous challenges that he faced as the Lord Lieutenant of Devon during the First World War.

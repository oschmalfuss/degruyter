As a key decision-maker, your capacity to craft astute talent decisions holds the potential to transcend your company from mere mediocrity to unparalleled excellence. However, brace yourself for a revelation: Many of your long-held convictions about talent may be profoundly flawed. What if we shared a secret that could revolutionise your perspective? What if the gateway to unleashing your team’s boundless talents resides within your thoughts and judgments? Imagine the possibilities if you could harness exponential outcomes by elevating the calibre of your decision-making. In ReThinking Talent Decisions, Sharna Wiblen, PhD, presents an uncomfortable truth: Talent decisions are always subjective. Drawing on examples from business, sports, movies and everyday interactions, Sharna emphasises the importance of understanding complexity and encourages deliberate, intentional, and informed decisions and conversations around talent. This indispensable guide will give you insight into: The Power of Personal Judgment: Learn how your own perspectives shape the today and the future of work. The Complexity of Talent Decisions: Recognise the critical need for key decision-makers to collectively define talent in your unique context. The Human Element: Understand how harnessing your mind can propel you, your team, and your organisation to new heights. Perceptions and Values: Learn how aligning perceptions and values can revolutionise your approach. A New Paradigm: Realise that talent management is a judgment-oriented endeavour. Navigating the Intersection of Talent and Technology: Delve into the world of technology systems and understand how they bolster and shape talent decisions in today’s digital age. ReThinking Talent Decisions is your secret weapon for achieving unparalleled success in the ever-competitive corporate arena. Whether you’re a seasoned executive or a rising star, the wisdom within these pages will empower you to master the art and science of talent decisions.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Social science has been a source of new and productive approaches to understanding ancient Greece, while classical Greek history and culture has been a touchstone for social theorists since the 19th century. This new collection of essays surveys the current state of the new field of ‘social science Greek history’ and demonstrates the potential of this interdisciplinary field.Substantial bodies of work that have contributed in fundamental ways to our understanding of classical Greece and its cultural legacy were produced in 20th century, by employing methods from anthropology, sociology, and psychology. More recently, the use of quantitative methods and formal theory, drawn from contemporary political science, economics, and sociology, has led to a new understanding of ancient Greek economic and political development. Meanwhile, normative considerations, drawn from contemporary political philosophy, have led to a richer understanding of Greek political thought and Greek institutional innovations – notably including democracy and the rule of law. Introduces a new field within classical studies Demonstrates the value of robustly interdisciplinary scholarshipShows the practical value of social science for ancient historyHighlights the importance of Greek case studies for social science Contributors include Sara Forsdyke, David Lewis, Robert Fleck and Andrew Hanssen  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Grounded in psychological and educational research on kindness and supported with illustrations capturing the voices of public school students, this book enhances our understanding of kindness. Written with educators in mind, Cultivating Kindness draws from surveys and interviews with more than three thousand children and adolescents. Author John-Tyler Binfet shares perspectives on kindness from the very individuals we hope will embrace kindness. Interwoven among examples from students are findings from peer-reviewed studies on topics exploring the role of joy and stress contagions on fostering or thwarting kindness, the concept of kind discipline, and how to measure kindness in school. This book also includes a kindness checklist to guide educators wishing to implement and foster kindness in their classrooms or schools. In addition to practical scenarios challenging the reader to respond kindly, a repository of kindness resources to support the continued kindness education of readers is also included.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

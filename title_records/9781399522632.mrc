Analysing literary texts alongside works of travel, geography, history and politics, this book demonstrates how ideas of Europe were shaped by real and imagined journeys across the globe and adapted across a range of discursive contexts for varied purposes. Using the notion of ‘imagined geography’ to present a conceptual map of what Europe looked like from different points across the globe, each chapter examines representations of the continent through the lens of one location (Brazil, Constantinople, Malta, Geneva). In a period of great intellectual transformation, as new interactions with cultures overseas reshaped how the wider world was understood, this focus on nationhood uncovers how, as the idea of ‘Europe’ developed, it emerged as a contested notion and an issue of debate.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

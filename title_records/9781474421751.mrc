The contemporary oil and gas industry is now intensely focussed on cost-saving and the UK has radical redrawn its revenue-raising expectations.This updated third edition has been published in two volumes: this volume focuses on commercial and contract law issues, while the other deals with resource management and regulatory law. The twin volumes bring together academic and practising lawyers, mainly based in Aberdeen, Europe’s Energy Capital, to consider the key regulatory and commercial dimensions of an ever-changing hydrocarbon province.New for this editionSignificantly revised to take account of new case law relevant to default provisions and contractual interpretationA significantly expanded treatment of upstream commercial issues, including new chapters on the LOGIC contracts and Drilling contractsAdditional midstream and downstream content, including new chapters by industry experts on transportation and oil sales agreementsContributorsJudith Aldersey-Williams, Partner, CMS, Nabarro and Olswang, Aberdeen.

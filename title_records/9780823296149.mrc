For, one of the way in which Western society might develop is toward a style of creative experience reminiscent of Taoism in China, especially now that the strengths of Western philosophy have been fully extended, if not indeed exhausted. Certainly we are rapidly approaching the limits to our growth and our dominance over nature, society, and human life. In Dr. Hall’s view, such control or dominance has been the governing factor in the development of the West; this may now develop into the style of experience and thinking indigenous to classical Oriental-especially Chinese-culture. In this philosophy of culture, Dr. Hall sets forth what he believes the flight of the phoenix into the future may bring. Many of his projections of this future philosophy will prove certainly uncomfortable if not downright bizarre to many. He grants there are other likely futures besides the one he posits, but these include the dead future of war or political decay, and he feels that there is also a place for a less frightening vision of the future. We might as well be at least prepared for the better as for the worse of our possible futures.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

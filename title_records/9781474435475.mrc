When treated this way, the text reveals itself as a guide to the education that Nietzsche prescribes for his best readers, at the brink of the new, post-moral era. Conway makes sense of the overarching aims and structure of the book at the same time as providing a broader context for the arguments Nietzsche makes and the positions he stakes out. Requiring no prior knowledge of the text or of Nietzsche, he guides you through the text with the reward of a more developed reading of the distinctly political agenda that emerges in the second half of Beyond Good and Evil.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

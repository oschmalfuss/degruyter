Underlying all the practical and policy choices are intriguing ethical and philosophical considerations which the book addresses head on, including debates about the goals of conservation in a pervasively humanised world.This is an ideal text for those studying Scotland’s environment at an undergraduate and graduate level, as well as for those already involved in – or interested in – managing land and nature in Scotland. Throughout, it is well illustrated with photographs and specially prepared maps and diagrams.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

The Court of Session records, uncovered by John Finlay, show a cross-section of Scottish society experiencing Edinburgh’s legal processes in the 18th century.18th-century Edinburgh owed much to the men who worked in the Court of Session as members of the unique institution known as the College of Justice. James Boswell, Lord Kames, Henry Dundas and Walter Scott are just some of those who emerged from the College to influence Scotland’s place in Europe.Key FeaturesAn original and wide-ranging study based on primary sources, including newly discovered records from the Court of SessionGives you insights into the history of urban administration, the legal profession and the Court of SessionConsiders the legal and social community responsible for the development of Scots law at a key period in its developmentFor anyone studying the sources and singularity of Scots Law, and the social history of the 18th century"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

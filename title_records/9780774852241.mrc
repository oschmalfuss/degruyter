The pressing need to answer this simple question is what prompted John Pierce and Ann Dale to gather the essays in this volume. Communities, Development, and Sustainability across Canada is a timely synthesis of work on how Canadian communities can achieve sustainable development. It bridges the gap between theory and praxis and brings together academics, policy makers, and community activists, all of whom have argued for increased local participation in sustainable community development. Communities have become the weak link in efforts to refashion relations between the environment and the economy. The goal of this book is not simply to describe problems but also to suggest answers, not simply to offer theory but also to promote action, so that Canadian communities can better achieve sustainable development. The twelve essays are organized into four sections: Vision, Connections, Action, and Assessing Progress. The first and last sections discuss local sustainable development within the context of increasing globalization. The second section approaches sustainable development from the perspective of social evolution and urban systems. The third section, the heart of the book, is comprised of three community case studies, an assessment of the Pacific salmon fishery, and four general discussions of sustainable development. The conclusion reiterates the need to make communities stronger links in sustainable development. The message of Communities, Development, and Sustainability across Canada is clear: it is time for communities themselves to act if they are to achieve sustainable development. This provocative and persuasive book will prove to be a valuable guide to taking the first steps.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

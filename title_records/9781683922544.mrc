The book discusses the importance of developing critical-thinking methods and skills, and develops a consistent approach toward each problem: 1) a precise description of a well-known AI problem coupled with an effective graphical representation; 2) discussion of possible approaches to solving each problem; 3) identifying and presenting the best known human solution to each problem; 4) evaluation and discussion of the Human Window aspects for the best solution; 5) a playability site where students can exercise the process of developing their solutions, as well as “experiencing” the best solution; 6) code or pseudo-code implementing the solution algorithm, and 7) academic references for each problem. Features: Addresses AI problems well known to computer science and mathematics students from a number of perspectives Covers classic AI problems such as Twelve Coins, Red Donkey, Cryptarithms, Rubik’s Cube, Missionaries/Cannibals, Knight’s Tour, Monty Hall, and more Includes a companion CD-ROM with source code, solutions, figures, and more Includes playability sites where students can exercise the process of developing their solutions Describes problem-solving methods which may be applied to many problem situations  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

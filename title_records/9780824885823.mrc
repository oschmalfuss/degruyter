Heat received from the sun dominates all other components of the heat exchange and directly influences the many varied and complex processes taking place in the surface layers of the atmosphere and ocean. It thereby determines the driving forces for all weather systems, of which the monsoon circulation is a striking example. The International Indian Ocean Expedition provided the opportunity to increase substantially an understanding of the distributions of solar radiation and other components of the radiative exchange by means of continuous measurements at several locations.This monograph describes a series of stations established to measure the amount of radiant heat received from the sun and atmosphere and discusses the results of an analysis of data obtained from them for 1963 and 1964. Information on cloudiness and water-surface temperature was used in the analysis for computing the remaining components of the net exchange of thermal radiation to arrive at monthly averages of net radiative exchange for the two years.An Investigation of Heat Exchange will be of special interest to meteorologists, physical oceanographers, marine biologists, and limnologists, as well as anyone needing information on the distributions of solar radiation and net radiative exchange for the Indian Ocean north of 25S latitude.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

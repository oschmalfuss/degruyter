Studying the documentary evidence, much of it available only recently, Jon Jacobson explores the personalities and politics of Locarno and offers a historical interpretation and synthesis of a critical decade in European diplomacy.Originally published in 1972.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

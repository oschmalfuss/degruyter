Use Agile methods to turn your IT challenges into high-value returns All too often, IT solutions are plagued by budget overruns, missed deadlines, low-quality outputs and dissatisfied users. Agile methods are proven, common-sense approaches for substantially increasing the relevance, quality, flexibility and bottom-line business value of your software solutions. Quantify and measure the benefits that Agile methods can deliver to your organisation. Agile methodologies such as Scrum, DSDM, FDD, Lean, XP and Kanban, are proven approaches for applying the finite resources of an organisation to deliver high business-value software solutions on time and within allocated budgets. These methodologies protect organisations from wasting their IT budgets by replacing large upfront financial commitments with incremental investment based on the ongoing business value of the delivered software. They encourage ongoing collaboration with key stakeholders, empower staff to regularly deliver fully functional and fully tested capabilities, and ensure that the IT solutions delivered are responsive to ongoing organisational and market changes.

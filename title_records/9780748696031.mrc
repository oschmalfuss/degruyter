Although not part of a structured film movement, directors such as Carlos Reygadas, Tsai Ming-liang, Béla Tarr, Pedro Costa and Kelly Reichardt have been largely subsumed under the term ‘slow cinema’. But what exactly is slow cinema? Is it a strictly recent phenomenon or an overarching cinematic tradition? And how exactly do slow cinemas interrelate on an aesthetic, technical and political level?Deploying the concept of slowness as an umbrella category under which filmmakers and traditions from different historical and geographical backgrounds can fruitfully converge, this innovative collection of essays interrogates and expands the frameworks that have generally informed slow cinema debates. Repositioning the term in a broader theoretical space, the book combines an array of fine-grained studies that will provide valuable insight into the notion of slowness in the cinema, while mapping out past and contemporary slow films across the globe.Key featuresEstablishes the significance of slow cinema studies in film scholarshipIlluminates the interconnectedness of past and present-day world cinemas through the methodological and comparative prism of slownessProvides in-depth critical analyses of a wide variety of world cinema traditions and practicesIntervenes in, and contributes to, key debates in current film scholarship: new technologies, art cinema, realism ContributorsMartin Brady teaches in the German and Film Studies Departments at King’s College London William Brown is Senior Lecturer in Film at the University of Roehampton, London Paul Cooke is Professor of German Cultural Studies and Director of the Centre for World Cinemas at the University of Leeds Glyn Davis is Chancellor’s Fellow and Reader in Screen Studies at the University of Edinburgh Elena Gorfinkel is Assistant Professor of Art History and Film Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Michael Gott is Assistant Professor of French at the University of Cincinnati, where he teaches courses in French and Francophone literature and cinema, European Studies, and film Asbjørn Grønstad is Professor of Visual Culture at the University of Bergen, where he is also founding director of the Nomadikon Center for Visual Culture Song Hwee Lim is Senior Lecturer in Film Studies at the University of Exeter Stephanie Lam is a PhD candidate in the Film and Visual Studies program at Harvard University Philippa Lovatt is a Lecturer in Media and Communications at the University of Stirling and also teaches at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City Cecília Mello is Lecturer in Film Studies in the Department of Film, Radio and Television, University of São Paulo, and FAPESP Senior Research Fellow in the Department of History of Art, Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil Matilda Mroz is Senior Lecturer in Film and Visual Culture at the University of Greenwich Lúcia Nagib is Professor of Film at the University of Reading Jacques Rancière is Professor Emeritus at the Université de Paris (St. Denis) Justin Remes is an assistant professor of film studies at Iowa State University Julian Ross is a researcher, curator and writer based in Amsterdam Karl Schoonover is Associate Professor of Film and Television Studies at the University of Warwick Patrick Brian Smith is a Frederick H.

For any personal or professional situation where formality is of the essence and proper decorum is the expectation, this book offers critical information on how to address, introduce, and communicate with officials, functionaries, and dignitaries from all walks of life. From presidents to pastors, ambassadors to attorneys general to your local alderperson, Honor and Respect offers clear explanations and examples of the official honorifics of thousands of federal, state, and municipal officials; corporate executives; clergy; tribal officials; and members of the armed services in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. It also includes titles and guidance on addressing high officials from more than 180 countries. This updated third edition reflects the nuanced changes in language, protocol, and conventions that have been implemented by the State Department, Armed Forces, and myriad other government offices in the United States and beyond. With its all-encompassing scope and quick-reference format, Honor and Respect provides easy access for all who seek the proper protocols of forms of address. This book is an indispensable reference for individuals and offices working in government, foreign affairs, diplomacy, law, the military, training and consulting, and public relations, among others.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

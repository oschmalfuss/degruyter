Extending the reach of her award†'winning book Dignity: Its Essential Role in   Resolving Conflict, Donna Hicks now contributes a specific, practical guide to achieving a culture of dignity.             Most people know very little about dignity, the author has found, and when leaders fail to respect the dignity of others, conflict and distrust ensue. Hicks highlights three components of leading with dignity: what one must know in order to honor dignity and avoid violating it; what one must do to lead with dignity; and how one can create a culture of dignity in any organization, whether corporate, religious, governmental, healthcare, or beyond. Brimming with key research findings, real†'life case studies, and workable recommendations, this book fills an important gap in our understanding of how best to be together in a conflict†'ridden world.    aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 22.

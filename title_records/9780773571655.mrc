They show that those who are heterosexual but suspected of being homosexual are most at risk of suicide and make recommendations for suicide prevention.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

While at first the idea of a Scottish essence seemed to promise the spiritual foundation MacDiarmid was seeking, as his poetry developed this idea became less important and he came to see poetry as an unrealizable ideal. This reading of MacDiarmid's poetry, relating it to the modernist movement, will be of value to readers interested in twentieth-century literature.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

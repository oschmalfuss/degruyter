Starting with 2015, these meetings were at first organized as National Symposiums, and, since 2018, they are held as International Conferences. Our purpose is that of rekindling the dialogue between theoreticians and practitioners in our country, at European level and not only.Each year, the participants' contributions were gathered in the pages of consistent volumes that have been indexed on international databases, so that their ideas and information can go further than the context of these meetings. Aims and Scope: promoting the results of theatre research at national and international level promoting young researchers passing the dialogue between theatre theoreticians and practitioners to the wide audience the continuous discovery of new ways to innovate stage practice, and the revitalization of theoretical resources creating teams of theatre researchers, professors and doctoral students, theoreticians and theatre practitioners following the transdisciplinary directions between theatre and connected areas: literature, film, music, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, etc. ABSTRACTING & INDEXING 1918-2018: 100 Years of Theater Research in Iași is covered by the following services: Baidu ScholarBayerische StaatsbibliothekBDSBowker Book DataCNKI Scholar (China National Knowledge Infrastructure)DimensionsEBSCOExLibrisGoogle BooksGoogle ScholarNavigaReadCubeSemantic ScholarTDOne (TDNet)WorldCat (OCLC)X-MOL Additionally, the proceedings volume is registered and indexed in the Crossref database and accessible on Amazon.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

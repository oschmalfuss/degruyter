In these famous essays. "The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious" and "On the Psychology of the Unconscious," he presented the essential core of his system. Historically, they mark the end of Jung's intimate association with Freud and sum up his attempt to integrate the psychological schools of Freud and Adler into a comprehensive framework. This is the first paperback publication of this key work in its revised and augmented second edition of 1966. The earliest versions of the Two Essays, "New Paths in Psychology" (1912) and "The Structure of the Unconscious" (1916), discovered among Jung's posthumous papers, are published in an appendix, to show the development of Jung's thought in later versions. As an aid to study, the index has been comprehensively expanded.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

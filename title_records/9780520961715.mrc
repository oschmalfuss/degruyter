A wealth of material.";-New York Times Winner of the 2017 Jon Gjerde Prize, Midwestern History AssociationWinner of the 2017 Award of Superior Achievement, Illinois State Historical Society Heralded as America's quintessentially modern city, Chicago has attracted the gaze of journalists, novelists, essayists, and scholars as much as any city in the nation. And, yet, few historians have attempted big-picture narratives of the city's transformation over the twentieth century. Chicago on the Make traces the evolution of the city's politics, culture, and economy as it grew from an unruly tangle of rail yards, slaughterhouses, factories, tenement houses, and fiercely defended ethnic neighborhoods into a truly global urban center. Reinterpreting the familiar narrative that Chicago's autocratic machine politics shaped its institutions and public life, Andrew J. Diamond demonstrates how the grassroots politics of race crippled progressive forces and enabled an alliance of downtown business interests to promote a neoliberal agenda that created stark inequalities. Chicago on the Make takes the story into the twenty-first century, chronicling Chicago's deeply entrenched social and urban problems as the city ascended to the national stage during the Obama years.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 16.

Not only have Mann's works, with very few exceptions, been translated but he is also one of the most eagerly collected of all modern authors. This volume will serve any student of literature, or collector, who is anxious to locate materials on Thomas Mann. Thomas Mann Studies, Volume II, is intended first of all as the bibliographical record for the period from 1954 to 1965.Since the death of Mann in 1955, a vast amount of material has been published about the man and his work. This extraordinary book lists almost four thousand items of criticism about the novelist which are not to be found in any previous bibliography. By far the majority of the items are in German, followed by a large number in English, French, Italian, and Swedish. Other languages represented include Japanese, Dutch, Spanish, Romanian, Danish, Polish, and Russian.Achieving its primary purpose of facilitating research in the rapidly growing area of Thomas Mann studies throughout the world, this book forms the complete record of critical, secondary literature about Mann, published as well as unpublished, through 1965. It also contains a comprehensive chapter on Mann's manuscripts, describing the public and private collections in which his papers are now preserved.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

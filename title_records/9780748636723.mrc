This book, newly available in paperback, sets out to remedy this neglect, offering:An account of military occupation as a form of governmentAn assessment of key trends in the development of military occupations over the last two centuriesAn explanation the conceptual and practical difficulties encountered by occupiersExamples drawn from, amongst others, the First and Second World Wars, US occupations in Latin America and Japan, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, and the current occupation of IraqAfter a survey of the evolving practice and meaning of military occupation the book deals with its contested definitions, challenging restrictive approaches that disguise the true extent of the incidence of military occupation. Subsequent chapters explain the diverse forms that military government within occupation regimes take on and the role of civilian governors and agencies within occupation regimes; the significance of military occupation for our understanding of political obligation; the concept of sovereignty; the nature and meaning of justice; and our evaluation of regime transformation under conditions of military occupation.Key FeaturesDeals with military occupation as a form of governmentDraws on a wide range of examples to illustrate themes such as political obligation, sovereignty and justiceArgues that military occupation covers a wider range than is often assumed, including 'international administration' under the auspices of the UN  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Their leaders face an equally complicated future, attempting to balance the needs and desires of students, faculty, governments, and the economy. Drawing on more than a decade of service as president of one of Canada’s major research universities, Peter MacKinnon offers an insider’s perspective on the challenges involved in bringing those constituencies together in the pursuit of excellence.Clear, contentious, and uncompromising, University Leadership and Public Policy in the Twenty-First Century offers a unique and timely analysis of the key policy issues affecting Canada’s university sector. Covering topics such as strategic planning, tuition policy, labour relations, and governance, MacKinnon draws on his experience leading the University of Saskatchewan to argue that Canadian universities must embrace competitiveness and change if they are to succeed in the global race for talent.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

The opening chapter introduces you to the key foundational terms and concepts, covering dialect, register, field, tenor, mode, choice, deviation, and foregrounding. The remaining chapters guide you from theory into practice. Each stylistic analysis chapter starts with a summary of the methodological toolkit that will be used, followed by systematic and guided stylistic analysis of a particular text type and plenty of practice activities.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Professor Philip here examines the evidence for these assertions, both in its general lines and in particular instances. As a basis for his own reconstruction he has taken what Aristotle tells us of the Pythagoreans, on the grounds that Aristotle is our earliest important witness, that the extent of his own testimony is considerable, and that he is not touched by the pro- or anti-Pythagorean bias of later writers. As a result of this investigation it is argued that substantial modifications must be made of generally accepted views of the role of Pythagoras and early Pythagoreans, and in consequence of the history of thought.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

This encryption can be relatively basic or maddeningly complex, and it might affect only a single device or a whole network. Ransomware is the fastest-growing malware in the world. In 2015, it cost companies around the world $325 million, which rose to $5 billion by 2017 and is set to hit $20 billion in 2021. The threat of ransomware is not going to disappear, and while the number of ransomware attacks remains steady, the damage they cause is significantly increasing.   It is the duty of all business leaders to protect their organisations and the data they rely on by doing whatever is reasonably possible to mitigate the risk posed by ransomware. To do that, though, they first need to understand the threats they are facing. The Ransomware Threat Landscape This book sets out clearly how ransomware works, to help business leaders better understand the strategic risks, and explores measures that can be put in place to protect the organisation. These measures are structured so that any organisation can approach them. Those with more resources and more complex environments can build them into a comprehensive system to minimise risks, while smaller organisations can secure their profiles with simpler, more straightforward implementation. Suitable for senior directors, compliance managers, privacy managers, privacy officers, IT staff, security analysts and admin staff – in fact, all staff who use their organisation’s network/online systems to perform their role – The Ransomware Threat Landscape: Prepare for, recognise and survive ransomware attacks will help readers understand the ransomware threat they face. From basic cyber hygiene to more advanced controls, the book gives practical guidance on individual activities, introduces implementation steps organisations can take to increase their cyber resilience, and explores why cyber security is imperative. Topics covered include: Introduction About ransomware Basic measures An anti-ransomware The control framework Risk management Controls Maturity Basic controls Additional controls for larger organiations Advanced controls Don’t delay – start protecting your organisation from ransomware and buy this book today!

Unlike the three preceding conferences (held in 1939, 1949, and 1959), the 1964 meeting chose one basic problem as its central theme: the comparative status of the individual in the major philosophical and cultural traditions of Asia and the West. One particular aspect of the overall problem was presented and discussed extensively in each of six sections: metaphysics, methodology, religion, ethics, social thought and institutions.This volume is composed primarily of the papers presented at the conference, containing also--in the form of questions and answers--some of the extensive, enlightening, and frequently controversial discussion that took place at formal and informal meetings, presenting papers and lectures were some thirty distinguished scholars and philosophers from India, China, japan, the United States, and Europe.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

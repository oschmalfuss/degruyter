In this groundbreaking study, authors Bruce Doern, Christopher Stoney, and Robert Hilton provide the first comprehensive overview of Canadian infrastructure policy, examining the impact and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid technological change as Canada looks to recover and rebuild.Covering more than fifty years across many sectors, the authors identify numerous challenges that have contributed to Canada's growing infrastructure deficit and suboptimal outcomes including political interference in the choice of infrastructure projects; challenges for multilevel governance such as distortion of local priorities, blurred accountability, and unsustainable maintenance costs for municipalities; the growing reliance on public-private partnerships that limit transparency and public scrutiny; and increased corruption associated with infrastructure projects.Transforming infrastructure is notoriously difficult yet vital at a time of rapid technological change. It is estimated that 75 percent of the infrastructure that will exist in 2050 does not exist today. This makes it crucial that Canada invest in future-proof infrastructure with the capacity to facilitate economic growth and the expansion of urban centres, mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, and ensure resilience in response to crises and disasters. Keeping Canada Running offers a timely assessment of these issues, Canada's COVID-19 response, and the potential contribution of the newly launched Canadian Infrastructure Bank.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

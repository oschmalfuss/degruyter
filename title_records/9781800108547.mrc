Although the court rolls span only fifteen years around the turn of the fifteenth century, the four different types of court they represent - manorial, market, fair and leet - are not replicated in the surviving records of any other medieval English small town. Also included are substantial sets of account rolls from the middle and later years of the fifteenth century which, in particular, provide details of the holdings, stalls and shops that were rented not just to Newmarket tenants but also to traders from further afield. Although the dates of the two sets of rolls do not coincide, their span across most of the fifteenth century provides substantive evidence for the growth and expansion of commercial activities, changing Newmarket from an inconsequential trading post into a significant and vibrant settlement, albeit small, on the main route between London and Norwich.The manorial rolls contain deletions and revisions, showing that they were used as working documents, indispensable to the lord of the manor's officials in overseeing the smooth running of the settlement and in ensuring the maximal receipt of all the income due to him. The commercial focus is a clear and vibrant reminder of the importance of markets to much of medieval society.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

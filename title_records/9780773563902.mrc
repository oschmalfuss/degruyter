This unique structure allows the authors to share their spontaneous discussion about a creative approach to the subject-matter. Most importantly, it offers an intimate connection between the reader and the artist-writers. By revealing the details of their creative struggles and the challenge of working together, Caiserman-Roth and Cohen hope to inspire readers to generate their own "dialogue" and make their own discoveries. The frank and personal disclosures and highly individual artistic styles of the authors will stimulate and encourage a diverse audience. Those who have always wanted to draw but have been afraid to try will be motivated to embark on the creative process. Artists who feel blocked will benefit from the insights of experienced colleagues. Those involved in the psychological or psychoanalytical facets of creativity will be fascinated by the different approaches of the artist-teacher and the psychoanalyst-artist. Art teachers and students will discover a wealth of new concepts which will enrich their work. Finally, the beautiful reproductions of the artists' work can be appreciated by all art lovers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

How can policymakers, Aboriginal organizations, and social scientists collaborate to best serve Aboriginal communities and the policymaking processes that affect them? Aboriginal Conditions considers such questions, with an aim to promote policymaking that is firmly based on social scientific evidence. Aimed at three main constituencies - Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal social scientists, government and Aboriginal policymakers, and Aboriginal communities - the book has multiple purposes. First, it presents findings from recent research, with the goal of advancing research agenda, and stimulating positive social development. Second, it encourages greater links between the social scientific and external research communities and demonstrates the kind of research needed as a foundation for public policy. Finally, it acts as a guide to research methods for Aboriginal communities and organizations, and promotes cooperation between researchers and Aboriginal peoples in an effort to ensure that research decisions serve both groups equally. A vital addition to public policy and Native studies, Aboriginal Conditions will be welcomed by social scientists, policymakers, and academics working in these fields.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

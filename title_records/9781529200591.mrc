Can this behaviour be influenced by management? Employee proactivity has largely been understood in terms of employees changing their environment or changing themselves. In this novel study Wu offers an alternative lens through which to examine such behaviour – the concept of attachment theory. Wu integrates the current understanding of motivational factors in shaping proactive workers, through his introduction to attachment theory, and development of it as a theoretical framework. This compelling approach provides academics with a new way of thinking about employee behaviour while also acting as a guide for practitioners and managers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

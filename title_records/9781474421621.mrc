This book focuses on how the ‘Reform Era’ has been constructed in the work of the director Jia Zhangke, analysing the archetypal class figures of worker, peasant, soldier, intellectual and entrepreneur that are found in his films. Examining how these figures are represented, and how Jia’s cinematography creates those ‘structures of feeling’ that concretise around a particular time and place, the book argues that Jia’s cinema should be understood not just as narratives that represent Chinese social transition, but also as an effort to engage the audience’s emotional responses through representation, symbolism and the affective experience of specific cinematic tropes.Making an important contribution to scholarship about the Reform Era, and opening up many new areas in the larger fields of Chinese visual culture, cultural studies and the affective qualities of film, this is groundbreaking work about a cinematic culture in a period of profound transformation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

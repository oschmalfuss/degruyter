Language is the key covers a range of topics: historical and political context that lead to the development of the Canadian standards, their current positioning in global educational markets, as well as their research and teaching cultures.  This edited volume provides a comprehensive overview of recent and ongoing projects and of CLB- and NCLC-related materials, tools and resources for teaching and assessment. Finally, it offers a bold outlook, proposing various scenarios to branch out beyond these benchmarks into the domains of higher education, essential skills, literacy, workplace training, as well as international and indigenous languages. The 20th anniversary of the CLB/NCLC provides an opportunity to reflect on the scope and importance of this exceptional Canadian intellectual product.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

Various changes in behaviour and activities have impacted to various sectors, as response to the need of containing the spread of the virus, which has claimed millions of victims. According to WHO records, until April 25, 2021, the number of deaths due to Covid-19 has reached 3.17 million worldwide. In the midst of efforts to overcome the pandemic, various steps have been taken by various health, economic, social and political entities. From a health standpoint, the pandemic is likely to end once the spread is controlled, among other things by finding a vaccine that can create immunity against the virus. Meanwhile, from an economic perspective, various actors strive to maintain a balance between the demands of limiting physical activities to prevent the virus from spreading and the demands for keeping economic activities going. The deliberation process in seeking a balance has given birth to an understanding that the pandemic, which is coming to an end, has left new traces in human interaction. Learning from the case of the swine flu pandemic (H1N1) that occurred in 2009, WHO confirmed that it would take a long time to declare an end to the pandemic situation. The swine flu pandemic took place from April 2009 to August 2010, or about 16 months. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic has now entered its 13th month, and the threat of spreading is still happening, as is currently happening in India. 2020 can be said to be a pandemic year. In this period, the approaches adopted by various governments had significant socio-political impacts, for example limiting the fundamental rights of citizens (namely the right to assembly, the right to move, the right to express opinions through demonstrations, and so on). These restrictions, without realizing it, have given birth to new awareness about the form of post-pandemic social interaction. The editor of the Opinion Juridica Journal, David Mandieta, wrote that post-pandemic societies face tough economic challenges. The liberal economic model which is now a global trend, is built on the principle of individualism which is complemented by ambition and egocentricity. This model seems inadequate to answer the global crisis (Mandieta, 2020). In the academic realm, various analyses to explain how the post-pandemic society is still speculative. This condition is understandable, given that the focus of research and academic studies during a pandemic period is more focused on overcoming health problems, and at the same time responding to the demands of economic needs. Therefore, a space is needed for researchers and academics to share and discuss ideas on how the structure, character, and patterns of community interaction will and should be created when the pandemic ends. Even so, the terminology of post pandemic society actually talks about how the social structure on a broad scale includes other social dimensions. An important lesson for social order that can be taken from a year of the pandemic's journey is that the global community needs an interaction mechanism based on the principles of more justice, promoting health, inclusion and sustainability. For this reason, we will organise an international conference and kindly invite scholars to discuss these issues.

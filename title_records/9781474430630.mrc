This volume presents twelve detailed studies dealing with cases drawn from the Middle East and North Africa in the period before independence (c.1850-1950). Framed by an authoritative introduction these explore the emergence of this important medium, its practitioners and its function as a forum and agent in political, social and cultural life in the Middle East. In taking up this focus, the collection argues that the press is both a vector and an agent of history that facilitates entrée into the complex process of political, social and cultural transformation that the region was undergoing during this critical period.Key FeaturesTwelve innovative case studies based on archival research cover the Ottoman Empire, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and MoroccoExplores social, political and cultural aspects of the press from the Ottoman Empire and the post-Ottoman Arab world including North Africa in the period before 1950An authoritative introduction reviews the state of the field of the press and media in Middle Eastern studies and place these contributions in contextGives a profile of the practitioners of journalism from political activists and amateurs to the emergence of the professional journalist in the Middle East  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Prior to Quebec's ";Quiet Revolution"; of the 1960s, local governments in Montreal both reflected and perpetuated the mutual isolation of French and English. Residential concentration in autonomous suburbs, together with self-contained networks of schools and social services, enabled English-speaking Montrealers to control the city's economy and to conduct their community's affairs with little regard for the French-speaking majority. The modernization of the Quebec state in the 1960s dramatically challenged this arrangement. The author demonstrates how the English-speaking politicians in cooperation with certain French-speaking allies have succeeded in preventing the wholesale adoption of ambitious schemes for metropolitan reorganization. He describes the workings of a society divided by language and ethnicity, where the pervasiveness of the politics of language impedes all plans for comprehensive metropolitan reform.

It covers the entire history of Spain's economic and social evolution from prehistoric times to the end of the nineteenth century. The book originated from lectures given at the University of Barcelona by Jaime Vicens Vives, who has been called Spain’s greatest historian in recent decades. Aware of all the major interpretations of Spanish history, the author draws upon the recent research of Spanish, French, and American historians; yet to the overall picture he gives his own imprint.Originally published in 1969.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

However, he grew dissatisfied with the purely critical form of his work as it seemed to simply subordinate philosophy to science and so simply reversed the old hierarchy.In Principles of Non-Philosophy Laruelle develops the concepts and method of a more democratic form of thought where neither science nor philosophy is subjected to one another, but brought together in a more productive theoretical and practical relationship. While the potential importance of this project is clear, Laruelle remains famously difficult.Key FeaturesProvides you with the essential historical background to non-philosophy, which Laruelle leaves out of his writingExplains how non-philosophy contributes to contemporary debates in European philosophy, especially in relation to the philosophy of science, theories of the subject and the role of translation in philosophyShows you how to use non-philosophy as a research paradigm for interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary workChapter-by-Chapter GuideChapter 1 explores the history of Laruelle’s non-philosophy with special attention to the relationship between science and philosophy, alongside of glosses on the important concepts of ‘the One’ and ‘radical immanence’Chapter 2 looks at Laruelle’s conception of a ‘unified theory of philosophy and science’ in dialogue with the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and the metamathematics of Kurt GödelChapter 3: provides the historical background for Laruelle’s conception of the ‘force-(of)-thought’Chapter 4 does the same for ‘determination-in-the-last-instance’ and also sketches a schematism of his conception of the One in dialogue with Fichte’s Science of KnowingChapter 5 turns to the method of dualysis and explores the way it functions. This is carried out by surveying three instances of dualysis:1) Being and Alterity or Otherness (with reference to the Greek and Jewish shape of contemporary European philosophy)2) Reason and mythology (with reference to the notion of universality in philosophy) 3) Life and death (with reference to the concept of the ‘lived’ in non-philosophy)Chapter 6 presents a reading of non-philosophy’s place on the contemporary philosophical landscape. While I accept that the distinction between analytic and Continental philosophy is largely artificial and intellectually untenable, the two terms are operative within academic philosophy and establish boundaries, however fuzzy, for certain concerns and concepts. Here we see how Laruelle takes up these concerns and concepts in a post-Continental form, before turning to look at some specific post-Kantian themes that are mutated and recast by non-philosophy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

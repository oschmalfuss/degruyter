The 'curse' of Sectarianism is debated in the Parliament, the General Assembly and in the media. What we have not had until now is a serious assessment of the evidence. This book tests the rhetoric with historical and social scientific data, describing and explaining the changing pattern of relations between Catholics and Protestants over the 20th century. It concludes that Catholic integration in Scotland has been far more successful than most commentators would have us believe. While there were once deep social, political, economic and cultural divisions, these have now all but disappeared. In Scotland's increasingly secular society, religious identity has steeply declined in social significance.The book is informed by both a considerable body of evidence from new historical research and major social surveys, and by the authors' understanding of what the mixing of religion and politics looks like elsewhere - in America, Australia and New Zealand, as well as in Ulster. Presenting a reasoned argument and up-to-date information, the book aims to contribute to a better-informed view of sectarianism in Scotland.Key FeaturesSteve Bruce - the main author - is a well-known figure in this field.Written in clear, accessible, arresting prose.The first book to challenge the view that Scotland is a society deeply divided by religion.A controversial take on a controversial subject - challenged long-held assumptions.

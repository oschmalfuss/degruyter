As the authority of the archive wrestles with the popularity of fictional narratives, this book delves into the debate on the relationship between fiction and documentary in hitherto neglected and surprising contexts. It offers the reader a unique approach to the study of archival footage and documentaries in relation to their fictional counterpart, mainstream films set in the same locations and addressing similar themes, including both live-action films and animations. From images of the places taken during or soon after the facts they represent to the intricacies of retrospective images of the events made years later, the films and footage investigated in this book offer a profound reflection on the ways in which we remember, imagine and experience the past through the complex mediation of film.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

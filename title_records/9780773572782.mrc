Miedema argues that the 1967 celebrations reveal the continued importance of religion to Canadian public life, showing that a waning "Christian Canada" was being replaced by an officially "interfaith" country. The author throws into bold relief the varied attempts of government officials and religious leaders to come to terms with new Canadian and global realities, as well as the response of Canadians to their own increasing religious diversity.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

In response to external economic and political pressures for change, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration developed new admissions criteria, while also going great lengths to personally process thousands of immigration cases on an individual basis. Making Middle-Class Multiculturalism is an important contribution to immigration policy in that it reveals the factors – in socioeconomic, racial, and moral terms – in conducting the criteria for permitting skilled workers and family-level migrants to Canada, a criteria that continues to shape policy immigration to this day. Using archival documents, examined through the lens of cultural sociology, this book reveals that the bureaucratic interpretations of immigration files emphasized not just economic utility, but also middle-class traits and values such as wealth accumulation, educational attainment, entrepreneurial spirit, resourcefulness, and a strong work ethic. By making "middle-class multiculturalism" a demographic reality and basis of nation-building in Canada, these state actors created an approach to managing racial diversity that at the onset was much-admired, but today, has generated significant social inequalities for immigrants and Canadian-born alike.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

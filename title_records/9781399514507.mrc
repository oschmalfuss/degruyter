By analysing narratives of collective memory, patriarchy and economic development, it shows the ways in which narratives shape politics in both intended and unintended ways. Meral Uğur-Çınar combines rich theoretical discussion with textual and ethnographic data, looking at how narratives serve the reproduction of consent as well as the mobilisation of resistance.Memory, Patriarchy and Economy in Turkey examines how narratives are utilised for the continuation of institutional structures as well as at critical junctures of institutional change and at the gradual erosion of institutions. Through the narrative analysis of texts, ranging from political speeches to museum documents as well as graffiti and posters from protests, the author sheds light on contemporary Turkish politics as well as offering a glance into how narratives operate in the political realm. Through this careful analysis, the book helps make sense of current political discussions in Turkey and elsewhere, particularly on issues such as democratic backsliding, institutional erosion, populism, polarisation and social movements.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

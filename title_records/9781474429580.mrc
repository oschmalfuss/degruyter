Leading Whitehead scholars give you exciting insights into the contemporary implications of Whitehead's symbolism in an era of new scientific, cultural and technological developments. As a result, Whitehead's philosophy is reinvigorated in the context of contemporary discussions and debates. This volume also serves as a critical point of entry into Whitehead’s more lengthy and complex work such as Process and Reality, and to his body of work as a whole.ContributorsJeffrey Bell, Professor of Philosophy at Southeastern Louisiana UniversityRoland Faber, Kilsby Family/John B.

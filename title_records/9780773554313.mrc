Transforming Conversations explores post-commission feminist thought and action in the contexts of primary, secondary, post-secondary, and adult education. In this volume, teachers, professors, and educational administrators – many trailblazers themselves – document the historical experiences and outcomes of feminist action in university faculties of education, departments of educational administration, academic and professional societies, teachers’ unions, and community groups over the past five decades. They begin by exploring liberal feminism as an initial response to the historical context in which female educators spoke up for women’s rights and reshaped formal education systems. The contributors further explore how feminist theory was reconceptualized as women moved into formal leadership roles across education sectors. Last, contributors consider female educators at the intersection of gender and other systems of exclusion, such as race and class, despite ostensibly inclusive feminist theory that continues to be bounded by Western, colonial, neoliberal ideologies. Transforming Conversations considers the complex effects feminism has had and continues to have on Canadian education, acknowledges voices that have been marginalized, and invites readers to continue a transformative feminist dialogue.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

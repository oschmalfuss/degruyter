Earlier Formulations of the Philosophy Underlying Social Work PracticeII. Public WelfareIll. PenologyIV. Final Statement of the Philosophy Underlying Social Work PracticeThis sharing of the wisdom and understanding of a lifetime dedicated to professional service in the field of social work will prove helpful and stimulating to administrators, teachers, and social workers everywhere.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

With its wide, objective and catholic vision, the Encyclopaedia demonstrates that psychoanalysis is a single discipline, very much greater than any particular movement, school or individual, including its founder, Freud. Thus the book contains authoritative entries on all the most important authors, practitioners, concepts, movements, schools, debates and controversies in psychoanalysis and its offspring, past and present. A précis essay is given of each school amplified by explanations of all key terms within that school. Entries are alphabetically arranged, fully cross-referenced, many with suggestions for further reading. Most importantly the book features both contributors and entries reflecting the various disciplines such as Feminism, Literature, Philosophy, Art and Anthropology that have contributed to the development of psychoanalysis or been influenced by it.Besides an immense array of topics on psychoanalysis contributed by psychoanalysts themselves, there are also entries on many topics written by psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, philosophers, medical researchers, historians, literary critics, anthropologists, linguists and other specialists. International in scope, the Encyclopaedia also draws on a geographically wide field of authors. The Encyclopaedia caters for readers who require knowledge at a glance as well as those seeking a more detailed account. Besides concise definitions, it includes numerous illuminating longer essays by distinguished contributors including: Peter Fonagy, Michael Eigen, James Grotstein, Eric Laurent, Thomas Ogden, Paul Roazen, Hazel Barnes, Charles Brenner, Marcia Cavell, Morris Eagle, Murray Stein, Allan Schore, Robert Stolorow and Robert Wallerstein.Key FeaturesEntries on all the concepts of the main psychoanalytic  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

The research (known as the Technology Adjustment Research Program, or TARP, of the Ontario Federation of Labour), was unique because, for the first time, government provided resources for workers, rather than just academics and corporations. TARP was established under the Ontario Liberals in 1990, renewed by the NDP government, and subsequently cancelled in 1995 by the newly elected Tory government. Nevertheless, new research has been added to this volume. This book will contribute to a better understanding of workplace change, the role of new technologies, the debate on lean production and empowerment of the workforce, the information highway, work and the environment, and the possibilities of shorter work hours. Despite the cancellation of government funding for further research, Re Shaping Work 2 sheds new light on crucial issues of the changing nature of work and technology. Re Shaping Work 2 is a book of great interest to students of workplace change, labour studies, and industrial relations, as well as trade unionists.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

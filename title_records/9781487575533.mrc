In all countries social security in still experimental, its principles and menthods are being actively reviewed, and nowhere has a final pattern evolved. In many countries the systems have grown piecemeal with numerous anomalies and gaps. Professor Richardson's survey is timely in directing attention to those basic principles and methods which are essential for sound progress. This book is based on Professor Richardson's extensive experience and research in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. He spent many months investigating personally the functioning of social security systems in North America, and in discussing the principles involved with officials and academics alike. Specially valuable is the chapter which considers what proportion of the national income can be afforded for social security, and also that on the alternatives of financing by accumulating large funds or by 'pay-as-you-go' methods. It is clear that the State may become financially over-burdened, and may also interfere too much with individual freedom. Professor Richardson concludes that when the State has ensured basic provision for their own special circumstances. He emphasises the flexibility of private occupational schemes and insurance to supplement basic State provision. The author directs particular attention to age and retirement, and urges that both social security systems and industrial organisation should be so devised as to give encouragement and facilities for older people to continue working as long as they are fit. He discusses public assistance, still extensively used especially in the United States, and concludes that it should be replaced by social insurance except in relation to a small residue of people. The review of the relative merits of flat-rate and of wage-related benefits is of special value in view of current political controversies in Britain, Sweden and other countries. Professor Richardson also discusses remedies for poverty arising from sickness and large families with low incomes. Comprehensive health services, unemployment insurance and compensation for industrial accidents he considers essential. The value of social security as a factor in economic security and in the redistribution of income, safeguards against inflation, and the problem of saving today for consumption in the future are also examined. The book is of special significance in relation to developments particularly in Britain, the United States and Canada. It also indicates possibilities of progress in the less developed countries.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Often they find themselves unprepared for professional life in these communities.Drawing on in-depth interviews conducted with more than forty practitioners working in a range of professions and communities throughout rural New Brunswick, The Tales that Bind presents a narrative approach to facing these challenges. Using fictionalized vignettes and autobiographical sketches, William Lowell Randall, Rosemary Clews, and Dolores Furlong argue that success as rural practitioners requires “knowing the story” – whether that is personal, communal, or regional.An accessible, practical guide to using narrative techniques in practice, The Tales that Bind is a unique resource for students, teachers, and professionals working in rural settings.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

With this surprising and timely book, Tristin K. Green takes us beyond diversity trainings and other individualized solutions to discrimination and inequality in employment, calling for sweeping changes in how the law and work organizations treat and shape racial emotions. Green provides readers with the latest research on racial emotions in interracial interactions and ties this research to thinking about discrimination and disadvantage at work. We see how our racial emotions can result in discrimination, and how our institutions—the law and work organizations—value and skew our racial emotions in ways that place the brunt of negative consequences on people of color. It turns out we need to reset our institutional and not just our personal radars on racial emotion to advance racial justice. Racial Emotion at Work shows how we can rise to the task.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

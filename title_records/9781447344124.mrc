There’s a thriving community of Asian people -- tIf you say Easterhouse to someone, the first thing they think of is normally gangs, violence and drugs -- tThere was a family on my floor: a mum, dad, sister and two brothers. None of them made it out -- tThe land was just sitting there and the idea came up about making an allotment on the bog land, so that the people in the community could grow their own fresh food -- tLong Melford -- tWhen I first found out I had MND, Steph had just given birth to Ralphie, so we went from that amazing high to being told that I’d got something that could potentially kill me in two years -- tI felt like a little invisible shadow. People knew, but I couldn’t tell anyone, as I was so scared that my child would be taken away. I thought if I kept my mouth shut, then at least I had my daughter -- tEven as a kid going to school, I felt like teachers had a handbook on how to deal with particular kids when it came to race. They’re so quick to kick us out of school -- tOrpington -- tThe cranes are like big guns aimed in on us. We are surrounded -- tI feel the country is more divided. Maybe because of Brexit, but it feels like the gap has widened between left and right -- tEmergency accommodation is supposed to mean anything from a week to six months. But I ended up being there for over a year -- tPilton, Edinburgh -- tA supervisor was bullying me, and when I confronted him he told me women are only here for having children, and called me a donkey -- tI think the EU got blamed for things it wasn’t responsible for, not that it was perfect. Some farmers saw the referendum as an opportunity to have change -- tThere were nine of us, all musicians. I was the only one who could speak English, not good, but better than the others, so I volunteered to speak about asylum -- tIt always seems to come down to money nowadays. And actually, what should be more important is what children need -- tI’ve been in trouble quite a lot in my life. Nothing too serious, and somehow I’ve only been to prison once -- tWe don’t have to accept this attack on our living standards, we don’t have to accept the demonisation of the various minorities, be they disabled, poor, single parents, immigrants or refugees -- tI try and bring a sense of love, belonging and family to the women. I believe in every one of them and I will never stop -- tI’m passionate about young people knowing that everything is political -- tI just couldn’t move. I was on that many different opiates, my body couldn’t cope with it -- tThe biggest thing for me about being a single parent is the fact that people do seem to think that it defines you in some way -- tBeing a trans woman in the 70s was exceedingly difficult. We weren’t breaking Queen’s Regulations by being transgendered, but the military police thought that it could be used against us -- tAm I accepted because I’m the token black woman to make up a percentage of black artists, or for my hard work and talent? -- tWhen I was selling drugs I was always thinking about the money. I didn’t actually see the effect it has on the users -- tPeckham -- tWe need to look more widely at the contribution that black people have historically made to British society -- tThe word ‘Islamophobia’ was something I learnt sometime after 9/11. Until then, I didn’t know what it was. I didn’t know that it was called Islamophobia until it formed into this thing that had a name -- tThe state of the country is terrible. Don’t even get me started. Theresa May, she gets on my nerves when she goes on -- tI struggle every day. I struggle to get up and even make myself food, and so I skip meals quite often -- tAt first I thought it was a good thing to go on strike, but it became clear that Maggie Thatcher was going to close us down all the same -- tWe’re still dealing with feudal law when it comes to housing, so we’re really up against it -- tMexborough -- tGovanhil -- tThe recession started again, hitting the building trade, and there was lots of pressure trying to keep everything together for the family. Things started to go wrong -- tI think applying for benefits is made really hard just to put people off. It can be the most stressful, soul-destroying thing ever in your life -- tPettigo -- tIn my first week at the London School of Economics a student told me I was part of the underclass because my family received benefits, and a lecturer said ‘Poor people don’t come to LSE’ -- tMental illness isn’t universal. You can’t just give somebody one thing and they feel better. Everybody has their own way of coping -- tWhen you’re an immigrant you feel like an invisible part of Britain. Until you’re ingrained in the culture, you’re not seen or heard -- tPHOTOGRAPHERS’ BIOGRAPHIES0 arestricted accessuhttp://purl.org/coar/access_right/c_16ecfonline access with authorization2star  aInvisible Britain: Portraits of Hope and Resilience reveals untold stories from people who have been left out of the media narrative and left behind by government policy.

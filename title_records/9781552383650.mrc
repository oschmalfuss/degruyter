Representing the constituency of Vegreville, Alberta, for the Social Credit party, Hlynka was a high-profile Member of Parliament who garnered much attention from the English-language press. He was instrumental in raising awareness of human rights issues and the plight of displaced persons following the Second World War and was a major supporter of the so-called third wave of Ukrainian immigrants to Canada. When he died unexpectedly at the age of fifty, Hlynka had begun work on his memoirs. Now, fifty years later, with the materials provided by his widow, Stephanie Hlynka, the editors of The Honourable Member for Vegreville: The Memoirs and Diary of Anthony Hlynka, M.P. (1940-49) have crafted a unique and significant contribution to the historical memory of Ukrainian Canadians.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

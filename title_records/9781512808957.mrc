Based upon years of research and painstaking consideration of all the significant publications on the subject, it clarifies a great deal that has been obscure in the transition from Latin to Old Portuguese, to modern Portuguese, and to Brazilian Portuguese. It also helps resolve many of the complex problems of Spanish and general Romance philology.For the second edition of From Latin to Portuguese, the author, Edwin B. Williams, has made substantial additions and revisions, has brought the bibliography up to date, and has utilized the latest research to reevaluate and confirm his original conclusions. In the light of these adjustments and the new material made available by Williams, this extraordinary synthesis must be classified as an indispensable handbook for the student and scholar working in the areas of Portuguese, Hispanic, and Romance philology.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Since the second edition of this book was published in 2000, a number of significant developments have occurred: a controversial referendum on treaty mandates was held; the historic Tsawwassen treaty, the first to be signed in the BC treaty process, finally came into effect; and a second treaty was signed with the five Maa-nulth First Nations on the west coast of Vancouver Island. A striking theme running through the narrative is the way in which the provincial government changed the way it approached the negotiations and its relations with First Nations. This updated edition includes a postscript, co-authored with Peter Colenbrander, which provides an extensive overview of the treaty process from 2001 to 2009. The authors outline the achievements of and challenges for the treaty process and review some of the most recent jurisprudence affecting Native and non-Native rights. They also reflect on the growing number of initiatives outside the treaty process to achieve reconciliation between First Nations and the Crown and raise questions about the future relationship between these initiatives and treaty negotiations. Treaty Talks in British Columbia is a valuable resource for those interested in Aboriginal issues and the treaty process both in BC and throughout Canada. Succinct, informative, and easy to read, this book brings clarity to a complex and often contentious issue.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

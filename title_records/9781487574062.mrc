The author of this book is convinced that the two are but different sides of the same coin, and that they should be presented together to a student of mathematics as soon as the curriculum will permit. Certainly, no graduate of an Honours course should miss at least a brief exposure to these stimulating ideas. When the first edition of this book appeared, a reviewer in the American Mathematical Monthly commented: ‘If this book had a subtitle, it might well have been “The Theorems of Desargues and Pappus,” for these two theorems play a central role throughout the text; their dependence and independence of various axioms is continually studied. Nowhere before, in English, has the importance of these two theorems been so carefully demonstrated…this is a most excellent book, and it will inspire many students of mathematics.’ Largely as a result of the work of Ruth Moufang, the interplay between algebraic and geometrical ideas has been further investigated of recent years. Many interesting problems have come to light, some of which have been solved. In this fourth edition, an Appendix has been added which attempts to summarize a part of this work and provide the reader with references so that he may learn more of these interesting developments.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

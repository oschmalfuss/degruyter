Thus, our research group led by Prof. Guo CHEN in Yunnan Minzu University is devoted to developing microwave heating applications in the production chain of titanium, and the corresponding results are summarized in this book.This book is divided into six chapters which initially look at the response and amenability of titanium-based elements tomicrowave power. Upon establishing its potential usefulness in titanium processing, the book assesses and introduces the various effects of microwave for different titanium related processes, including preweakening, drying, carbothermic reduction, leaching and roasting. A wide variety of analysis tools to determine the effects of microwave on these processes were utilized to support and explain the results. These include DSC, Raman, FTIR, SEM, EDAX. Finally, life cycle analysis was used to evaluate and to optimize microwave heating devices to provide information for further development of this process in the titanium industry. We hope this compilation can provide researchers and professionals working in the general minerals processing field the benefits of the microwave technique.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

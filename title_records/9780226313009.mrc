As plays, the works were incomplete without physical items-theatrical props. In this book, Melissa Mueller ingeniously demonstrates the importance of objects in the staging and reception of Athenian tragedy. As Mueller shows, props such as weapons, textiles, and even letters were often fully integrated into a play's action. They could provoke surprising plot turns, elicit bold viewer reactions, and provide some of tragedy's most thrilling moments. Whether the sword of Sophocles's Ajax, the tapestry in Aeschylus's Agamemnon, or the tablet of Euripides's Hippolytus, props demanded attention as a means of uniting-or disrupting-time, space, and genre. Insightful and original, Objects as Actors offers a fresh perspective on the central tragic texts-and encourages us to rethink ancient theater as a whole.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

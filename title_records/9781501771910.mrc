This book will help the educator:- Learn successful routines and practices to make learning outdoors safe and engaging- Understand protocols for real and risky play- Draw inspiration from real-life stories from other teachers about learning in nature- Meet NGSS and Common Core standards outdoors with seasonal lessons that are child-centered- Be part of the movement to support children in becoming reconnected with the natural world and the places they call homeWith twenty-five lessons in five units of study spread out across a seasonal school year and appendixes that offer templates for learning, Educating Children Outdoors is essential for educators looking to harvest the benefits of a nature-based curriculum.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

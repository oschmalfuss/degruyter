Staffordis one such town, and the large-scale archaeological examinations undertaken there over the last fifty years have provided an extraordinary, unique opportunity to piece together the history of such a "typical" town. A centre forthe delivery of grain tribute during the Dark Ages, it was commandeered in the tenth century by Aethelflaeda in order to construct a burh there. This new foundation was a fort, provided with a vicus in which the centralised production of Roman-style pottery ("Stafford Ware") was undertaken and supplied to the chain of west midlands burhs. The case of Stafford has prompted a new review of the origins of county towns as a whole, and the composition of a new model for the birth of the Anglo-Saxon borough on which the local administration of England has ever since been based. Martin Carver is Professor Emeritus of Archaeology at the University of York.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

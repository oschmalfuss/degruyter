This volume addresses a wide range of policy concerns, including: Who should receive limited federal housing resources? How and to what extent should we preserve the existing, private, subsidized, and public low income housing stock? What are the appropriate roles for the federal, state and local governments, the nonprofits and the private sector in delivering housing programs? This comprehensive study of housing policy in the U.S. is the result of the MIT Housing Policy Project (1987-89), which was directed by the editors.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

These changes affect asset values, interest rates, stock valuations, barriers to entry, as well as regression and correlation analysis. That Doesn't Work Anymore discusses how to adapt traditional data to these changes and outlines ways to use newer and better tools that help you make good investment and business decisions. The book's short pragmatic chapters grouped by topic with research and real-life anecdotes delve into how technological and societal developments have changed the meaning and value of traditional economic data-points, predictive tools, and business concepts. Robert S. Kricheff provides specifics on new and more valuable data sources as well as better methods for applying the information to investing, business, and even your career.   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

The book deals with police attempts to discredit the NCCL and the use of intelligence to perpetuate a view of the organisation as a front for the Communist Party. It also examines the state and police responses to this organised criticism of police powers. This book is essential reading for students and lecturers studying British social history, the development of civil liberties and of policing in Britain, as well as anyone interested in this enduring topic. Included is a foreword by Clive Emsley, Emeritus Professor in History at the Open University, and widely regarded as the doyen of police history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

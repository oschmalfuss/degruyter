It shows that although there are differences between conventional and Islamic asset management, these do not appear to have a significant impact on how the funds perform. Shari'ah compliant funds are therefore an attractive alternative for Muslim and non-Muslim investors alike.Key Features * Contains valuable information on Shari'ah compliant fund structures and the type of instruments that can be invested in * Considers practical implementation matters such as operational issues, available indices and the role of the Shari'ah Supervisory Board * Includes case studies of the funds available to investors including the BLME $ Income Fund, SWIP Islamic Global Equity Fund, the Saudi Al Rajhi Fund Range and the Malaysian blue chip i-VCAP-MyETF-DJIM25 * Features a glossary of abbreviations and key Arabic terms * Relevant to investors and practitioners in the industry, and to non-Muslims interested in investing based on the same set of principles, norms and values  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

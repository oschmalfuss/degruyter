In addition to the rules applicable to all classes of insurance published in the first edition, this edition also includes provisions on liability insurance, life insurance and group insurance. The PEICL were drafted as a model for an optional instrument of European insurance contract law and are currently being considered as such at EU level. This volume is also expanded in the number of translations provided. In addition to the updated translations in Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish and Swedish, the PEICL rules have now also been translated into Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Serbian and Turkish. A short introduction sets out the approach used by the Project Group, the need for a common European insurance contract law, arguments in favour of introducing such a law by means of an optional instrument, as well as the political developments currently taking place. Essential reading for anyone concerned with the transnational dimension of insurance law.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

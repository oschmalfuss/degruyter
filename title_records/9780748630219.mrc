The book also shows how these conflicting energies animated the late nineteenth century’s most exciting transatlantic cultural enterprise.Richly illustrated and historically detailed, this study of James’s and Wilde’s intricate, decades-long relationship brings to light Aestheticism’s truly transatlantic nature through close readings of both authors’ works, as well as nineteenth-century art, periodicals and rare manuscripts. As Mendelssohn shows, both authors were deeply influenced by the visual and decorative arts, and by contemporary artists such as George Du Maurier and James McNeill Whistler. Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Aesthetic Culture offers a nuanced reading of a complex relationship that promises to transform the way in which we imagine late nineteenth-century British and American literary culture.Key FeaturesThe first study devoted exclusively to Wilde and James, who are the most important Irish and American nineteenth-century authorsRewrites standard assumptions about James's and Wilde's relationship and traces its implications for British and American AestheticismRedefines Aestheticism and offers full re-readings of late nineteenth-century literature, visual and material culture, theatre, as well as psychology and sexual identityRefers to several previously unpublished letters by Henry James  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

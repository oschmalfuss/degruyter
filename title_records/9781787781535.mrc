Implementing an effective EnMS (energy management system) that complies with ISO 50001 ensures that an organisation can: Meet legal and contractual energy compliance requirements; Save money by managing energy more efficiently; Reduce its carbon footprint; Increase energy security; and Demonstrate a commitment to improved energy performance. With energy security concerns rising and climate change an existential threat, consumers are increasingly aware of sustainability issues. ISO 50001 – A strategic guide to establishing an energy management system provides a practical but strategic overview for leadership teams of what an EnMS is and how implementing one can bring added value to an organisation. It: Explains how ISO 50001:2018 (which is based on ISO’s Annex SL) differs from the previous version of the Standard; Provides readers with a greater understanding of what energy management is and how taking a risk-based approach can save money and improve brand reputation; and Covers how ISO 50001 can be implemented and how the EnMS can be integrated with other management systems, such as an ISO 14001 EMS (environmental management system).

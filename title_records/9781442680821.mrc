His performance is for the first time made accessible in these volumes, which allow us to place Mill firmly in a political landscape whose features were undergoing a bewilderingly swift metamorphosis, to capture the complexity and fluidity of the situation, and to evaluate his purposes and means.In the historical introduction, Bruce L. Kinzer describes the political forces and personal aspirations that shaped Mill?s parliamentary career and illuminated its consistency and integrity. In the textual introduction, John M. Robson discusses the editorial problems raised by the texts, and explains the principles that have been applied to them.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

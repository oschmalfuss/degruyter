Various works habe been published by Indian scholars, but these erudite studies have generally been written for Indian readers or Orientalists, and deal with rather specialized fields. Although there are several American publications on Chinese political theory, the Indian field has been largely neglected in this country. tHe plan of the present work is to construct a brief analysis of Indian thought together with a series of sections from the Hindu political classics. --From the Preface This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

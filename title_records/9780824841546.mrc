The author, an experienced divorce lawyer, presents the most recent developments in child support guidelines; laws affecting property division, military retirement, alimony taxes; and court procedures, including the requirement of mediation in all cases.Offering dozens of suggestions on how to negotiate a fair settlement with your spouse, it answers questions about alimony, child custody and support, property division, and tax and debt responsibilities. An entire chapter is devoted to the special problems of military personnel. There is even a chapter on pre- and postmarital agreements and palimony. Not intended as a substitute for an attorney, this book will, however, give you a broad understanding of the divorce process in Hawaii and the knowledge of how to fully protect your rights.

So decisive was the role of religion in the worlds of Irish settlement that it helped to create a "Greater Ireland" that encompassed the entire English-speaking world and beyond. Rejecting the popular notion that the Irish were passive victims of imperial oppression, Religion and Greater Ireland demonstrates how religion opened up a vast world to exploit. The religious free market of the United States and the British Empire provided an opportunity and a level playing-field in which the Irish could compete and thrive. Contributors to this collection show how the Irish of all denominations contributed to the creation and extension of Greater Ireland through missionary and temperance societies, media, and the circulation of people, ideas, and material culture around the world. Essays also detail the diverse experiences of Irish immigrants, whether they were Catholics or Protestants, clergy or laypeople, women or men, in sites of settlement and mission including the United States, Canada, South Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland itself. Seeking to illuminate the interconnections and commonalities of the Irish migrant experience, Religion and Greater Ireland provides fascinating insight into the range of influences that Ireland’s religions have had on the world beyond the British Isles.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

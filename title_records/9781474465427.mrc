The author examines the formations of narratives of identity in contemporary 'borderline' fictions and films. The work of migrant and marginalised groups located at the boundaries of nations, cultures, classes, ethnicities, sexualities and genders, is explored through an intricate weaving of theory with textual analysis. Organised around the themes of memory, tradition and 'belonging', the book proposes the space of 'migrant' writing - an emerging third space - as one that challenges fixed assumptions about identity.The cross-cultural range - including texts from British, Caribbean, Chinese-American, Indo-Caribbean, Canadian, Cuban and Indian writers; the original discussion of authors such as Maxine Hong Kingston, Gloria Anzaldua, Amy Tan, Gish Jen, Hanif Kureishi and Chang-rae Lee; and engagement with the work of theorists including Bakhtin, Freud, Lyotard, de Certeau, Deleuze and Guattari, produces a significant contribution to the broadening definitions of ethnicity and the 'post-colonial'.Works explored include Jasmine, Borderlands, The Joy Luck Club, The Wedding Banquet, Dreaming in Cuban, My Year of Meat, Buddha of Suburbia and East is East. These contemporary texts and films will make this book accessible to a broad range of readers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

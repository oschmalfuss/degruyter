To assist them, the NUM set up a job creation programme, starting with worker co-operatives before shifting to wider enterprise development strategies. Against the backdrop of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy, this programme provided support in communities hard hit by escalating job losses onthe mines - including in neighbouring countries. In this book, Kate Philip, who ran NUM's job creation programme for over a decade, charts the often-difficult lessons learned from grappling with the limits and opportunities thatsuch market participation offer to reduce poverty and improve livelihoods. She explores whether and how it might be possible to make markets work better for the poor - and what the notion that markets are social constructs might mean for constructing them differently. Kate Philip is a Senior Economic Development Advisor in the Government Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC) of South Africa's National Treasury. Through the International Labour Organisation, she has also been supporting the government of Greece in the design and development of a public employment programme.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

For the first time, Supporting people explores with service users, practitioners, carers and managers what person-centred support means to them, what barriers stand in its way and how these can be overcome. It provides a unique roadmap for the future, offering theoretical insights, practical guidance and highlighting the importance of a participatory approach. Based on the largest independent UK study of person-centred support and written by an experienced team that includes service users, practitioners and researchers, it demonstrates how change can be made now, and what strategic changes will be needed for person-centred support to have a sustainable future.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

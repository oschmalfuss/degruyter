'At Chicago,' Leacock wrote wryly, 'they made a general pretense that I was fir for the graduate school in economics. It is a little hard to see why, except that I was obviously not fit to die.' Leacock graduated from the university in 1903. Carl Spadoni's discovery of his dissertation -- previously thought to be lost, and unread since Leacock defended it -- gives readers a unique opportunity to re-examine Leacock's philosophies. 'The Doctrine of Laissez Faire' reveals the early roots of his skepticism about political economy, on which his later works of humour fed. In it, Leacock attempts to demystify the dogmatic opposition to state intervention based on this economic precept. In his introduction, Spadoni provides the historical background for an intellectual understanding Leacock's thesis. The first part of this book, 'My Recollection of Chicago,' is a short essay by Leacock in which he reminisces on his graduate years at Chicago. The second part comprises his newly unearthed thesis. Together, these two pieces shed new light on one of the major figures of Canadian culture.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

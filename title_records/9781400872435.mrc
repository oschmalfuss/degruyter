In 1906, after he had become senior staff physician and before his first meeting with Freud in Vienna in 1907, Jung wrote his famous monograph "On the Psychology of Dementia Praecox." Ernest Jones described it as "a book that made history in psychiatry and extended many of Freud's ideas into the realm of the psychoses proper." A. A. Brill (whose introduction to his 1936 translation is included here) has called this work indispensable for every student of psychiatry—"the work which firmly established Jung as a pioneer and scientific contributor to psychiatry."Originally published in 1974.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

And increasingly, consumers want firms to take a lead in helping to shape a better society. Yet, most don’t know where to start or have struggled to get things right.In Marketplace Dignity, Cait Lamberton, Neela A. Saldanha, and Tom Wein introduce a tangible, practical way to take a stand on the fundamental value of humans, and in so doing, be a force for good in a society that increasingly demands that they do so. Marketplace dignity is the idea that customers seek respect and recognition from the firms they interact with, not just rational or emotional benefits. Marketplace dignity appeals to humans’ sense of justice and goes to the essence of what makes customers human. It is also a powerful driver of their engagement, loyalty, and satisfaction.In this book, you will discover how to:+ Apply the principles of marketplace dignity to the whole of the customer journey, from the pre-consumption phase to the post-consumption phase;+ Design and deliver products, services, and experiences that respect your customers’ dignity and value as human beings;+ Improve your performance using the Marketplace Dignity Framework, which is underpinned by representation, agency, and equality; and+ Create a competitive edge and a positive social impact with marketplace dignity.Drawing on the authors’ rigorous research, as well as the successes and failures of companies around the world, from Fortune 100 companies to nonprofits to independent organizations, Marketplace Dignity will empower you to diagnose, understand, and enhance the way that you engage with your customer base across the entirety of their journey with your organization.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The book captures the flavor of a lively debate between academics and policy analysts, and the commentaries and discussion sections provide, in non-technical language, a statement of some major questions confronting government policy on housing.In addition to its use as a record of an important Canadian conference, the book is a valuable collection of recent housing research. The ten papers cover a wide variety of topics ranging from conceptual and methodological issues on the one hand to critiques of Canadian housing policies on the other. They indicate the range of issues which must be taken into account in assessing housing policy. Taken together with the discussion material which helps to focus attention on strategic issues in both Canada and the United States, they provide a useful introduction to current debates over housing policy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

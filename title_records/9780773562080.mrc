He focused most of his attention on the gold standard and its inhibitory effect on the growth of the economy. Long before the development of modern schools of economic theory, Attwood sought the regulation of business through control of the money supply. He was unsuccessful in his challenge to the Ricardian school, which promised stability through a gold based economy, and died disillusioned. Birmingham became identified with his brand of economic theory and a succession of economists followed his lead into the national arena. Through his study of Attwood's career and the development of his philosophy, David Moss reveals the impact of industrialism on the individual and society.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

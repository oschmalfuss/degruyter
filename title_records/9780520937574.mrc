Blanchfield conducts readers through a unique, theatrical realm where concepts and personages are enlivened into action: Continuity, Coincidence, Symmetry, and Shame keep uneasy company there with Marcel Duchamp and Johnny Weissmuller, Lord Alfred Douglas and "Blue Boy" Master Lambton, Juliet's Nurse and Althusser's Moses.With its kinked and suspensive language, Not Even Then draws on the lyric tradition, even as it complicates that tradition's dualism of self and other. Likeness is always under investigation in the book's irreducible arrangements of alterity. From "Red Habits": "I imagine the interferences explained / in don't-think-twice and reverse advice / and by habits for both head and breast / hers and hers as red as mine at chamber check. / We are each herself a further interference." No answer rests unquestioned in its turn; even the book title's cynicism is challenged by a poetics alive to possibility, where Possibility is-impetuously, ecstatically-companionable. "The listener you are," writes Blanchfield, "the less alone."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

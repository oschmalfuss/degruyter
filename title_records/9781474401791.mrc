Lawrence stakes out the historical nuance of Allah throughout the past 1500 years, from the earliest mention of his name to his appropriation by cyberspace. It introduces a broad range of perspectives, practices and problems linked to Allah, including debates that are intra-religious as well as inter-religious, concerning differences among Muslims as well as between Muslims and non-Muslim others. Chapters cover the range of Muslim perspectives on Allah and tackle such topics as war in the name of Allah and controversies about the use of the name Allah/ God. Throughout the author highlights the need to look at Islam with fresh eyes and to understand Allah/ God with dispassionate insight.Key FeaturesMixes historical overview with contemporary analysisIncludes a guide to further reading and a glossary of technical termsConsiders the future of Allah in cyberspaceIncludes sidebars to illustrate key terms and a glossary of Arabic/ Islamic words, persons and practices  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

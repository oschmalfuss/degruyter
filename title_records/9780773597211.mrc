Sudanese immigration to Canada and the transnational ties between the two countries are illuminated in the context of various case studies. Tensions, both social and political, are discussed through the recent secession of South Sudan, the Darfur conflict, and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. The authors also broach the reconstruction efforts in education and health initiatives, transnationalism from below, and Canada’s role in conflict resolution in Sudan. Using qualitative and quantitative research methods that include interviews, surveys, participant observations, discourse analyses, and document analyses, researchers from a wide range of disciplinary approaches - sociology, anthropology, political science, social work, and health studies - reveal important conceptual and empirical perspectives about the processes of inclusion and exclusion. At a time when the Sudanese diaspora in Canada is growing and the conflict in Sudan has become a preoccupation of the international community, Canada in Sudan, Sudan in Canada reveals the root causes of conflict in Sudan and identifies measures to foster peace, stability, and development.

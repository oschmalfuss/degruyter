Doing good, however, is not as simple and straightforward as it might appear. Practices of solidarity are intertwined with questions of power. They are situated, relative and contested, unfolding in an ambivalent space between humanitarianism and political activism. This ethnographic account of the German »welcome culture« provides insights into the contested practices, imaginaries, interests and politics of refugee solidarity. Drawing on works from critical migration studies to social anthropology, Larissa Fleischmann develops an empirically grounded understanding of solidarity in migration societies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

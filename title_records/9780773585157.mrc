His mother's fifteenth child, he grew up in an Italian Catholic family on a street full of proud families with a multitude of languages and backgrounds. From being packed into the local church, to working and borrowing his way through medical school at McGill while surviving several severe illnesses, to his very successful career as a doctor in California, his story is entwined with those of everyone from foundry workers to foreign ambassadors. A warm and informative look at the challenging journey made by so many, Alice Street is a testament to the strength and character needed to make it through tumultuous times.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

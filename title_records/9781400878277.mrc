Prior to the nineteenth century Mr. Landen finds that native Omanis had developed a thriving maritime industry which was responsible for the country's economic health. With the advent of colonialism from the West, Oman’s fortunes declined. The changes that took place, the influence of British leaders who directed the political activities in Oman, and the internal politics of Oman are all considered. The last chapter contains speculations on the effect of the discovery of oil on the future of Oman.Originally published in 1967.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

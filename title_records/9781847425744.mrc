Housing associations - rehousing women leaving domestic violence will fill a gap in the literature for academic staff and students interested in housing studies, social policy, sociology, women's studies, political studies and organisation/management studies; provide valuable guidance to staff in housing associations and local authorities working in general needs housing, supported housing and homeless services; and provide policy makers with a useful introduction to key issues.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

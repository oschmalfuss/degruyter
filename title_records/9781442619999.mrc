Among the topics examined are paradigmatic changes in teacher education, the impact of the Bologna process in Europe, Indigenous education, and state policies in a transnational context.With contributors from nine countries on four continents, Teacher Education in a Transnational World offers a genuinely international interdisciplinary examination of the challenges and opportunities associated with teacher education in the twenty-first century.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 15.

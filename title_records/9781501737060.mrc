It contains four essays, including two case studies of local hospitals-one urban, the other rural-in transition, a photographic essay of life in community hospitals, and an account of the attempt to move black hospitals into the mainstream during the years 1920 to 1945.Part Two focuses on the professional communities within the hospital, Four essays explore the impact of technology on the modern hospital, science and the nursing profession, the changing education of hospital administrators, and the coming of age, in the 1960s, of the first hospital workers' union. A concluding article addresses crucial public policy issues and consider s prospects for the future of the American general hospital.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

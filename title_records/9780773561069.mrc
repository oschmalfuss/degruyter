His first section describes the musical activity generated by moral crusaders, philanthropists, educationalists, and reformers who sought to use music as a method of instilling habits of mind and body in the English working classes. The second studies the musical forms developed by entrepreneurs, particularly in the music halls. The third section focuses on the music and musical institutions produced by the community, illustrating the popular capacity for making as well as enjoying music. Perhaps most important, in this first thorough social history of popular music Russell shows how ideas and experiences gained through various forms of popular musical activity influenced popular political life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

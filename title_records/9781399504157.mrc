Bringing together all of Mansfield’s poetry (some 179 poems and several songs), her literary translations (including letters by Anton Chekhov as well as those of Dostoevsky to his wife), her witty, sometimes scorching, parodies and pastiches, her imaginative aphorisms, her many incisive and heartfelt reviews of the novels of the day, and her essays, including those for the little magazine, Rhythm, this collection attests to the enormous variety and distinctiveness of the non-fiction writing that Mansfield produced, some of it unpublished until this edition. For the first time, Mansfield scholars and devotees can read all of Mansfield’s non-fiction work, which expands considerably on previous partial editions of her poems or critical writings. Arranged chronologically, and with perceptive notes and a General Introduction by two leading Mansfield scholars, this is, at last, the Edition that Mansfield deserves.This volume of Mansfield’s poetry and critical writing comprises:Book reviews (not collected since 1987 and incomplete)Poetry (not collected since 1988 and incomplete)Translations (not previously collected)Essays (not collected since 1987 and incomplete)Parodies (not previously collected)Pastiches (not previously collected)Key FeaturesMaterial has been out of print for decadesFully annotatedSome material has never been collected or seen before  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

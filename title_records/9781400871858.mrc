Meredith was concerned with "readable people," by whom he meant his readers (as he imagined them and as they were), his characters (as he created them and as they were perceived), and himself. Focusing on Meredith's struggle to shape and change the reader, Judith Wilt examines five novels: The Ordeal of Richard Feverel, Sandra Belloni, The Egoist, One of Our Conquerors, and The Amazing Marriage. Her analysis develops a theory of Meredith's artistic processes and relates his concerns to those of recent fiction.Originally published in 1975.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

It describes the legal framework for working with older people following the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 and the modernising agenda in health and social care. Covering broadly the same ground as the first edition, the length has been considerably expanded to enable topics to be dealt with more comprehensively. It covers the range of legal issues affecting the welfare and financial security of older people in the community and residential settings, and emphasises the empowering nature of legal knowledge. It also describes and explains the application of law and policy relating to older people in the context of social work practice. Written by a social worker and a lawyer, the book highlights the opportunities for interprofessional working and combines professional perspectives on: · providing health and social care services in the community; · housing needs and entering residential care; · dealing with financial matters; · end of life issues. Older people and the law is aimed at all professionals working with older people, but particularly social workers. Its clarity of style means that older people themselves and carers will find it accessible.

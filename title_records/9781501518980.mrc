It bridges the gap between the physiological andpsychological impacts of stress on the microbiome, offering both theoretical insights and practical applications for a healthier future. The book challenges the prevailing narrative of disease and pathology by shifting ourunderstanding towards health. It introduces readers to the awe-inspiring world of the microbiome, revealing that our bodies are not just individual entities, but superorganisms intricately connected to trillions of microbes.These microbes, outnumbering our own cells 10 to 1, create a complex and diverse ecosystem that plays afundamental role in shaping who we are. The author’s exploration of this new understanding reshapes ourperception of humanity, emphasizing that we are no longer just “I” but rather a collective “we.” The bookunderscores the critical importance of nurturing a healthy inner garden for our microbiome to flourish as theprimary means to create health.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

Since that time the availability of Hemingway's papers, coupled with new critical and theoretical approaches, has enlivened and enlarged the field of American literary studies. This companion volume reflects current scholarship and draws together essays that were either published during the past decade or written for this collection.The contributors interpret a variety of individual stories from a number of different critical points of view-from a Lacanian reading of Hemingway's "After the Storm" to a semiotic analysis of "A Very Short Story" to an historical-biographical analysis of "Old Man at the Bridge." In identifying the short story as one of Hemingway's principal thematic and technical tools, this volume reaffirms a focus on the short story as Hemingway's best work. An overview essay covers Hemingway criticism published since the last volume, and the bibliographical checklist to Hemingway short fiction criticism, which covers 1975 to mid-1989, has doubled in size.Contributors.

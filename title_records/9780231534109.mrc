Answering the urgent call for a textbook that deals with specifically with adults in this setting, Goldie Kadushin and Marcia Egan synthesize empirical research to extract practical applications for practice, emphasizing the "how to" of gerontological home health care by discussing the field's most relevant issues. The authors include chapters on home health care policies and funding, cultural and diversity issues, the contemporary challenges of the social work role in home health care, the development of a relationship, the client's role in helping with care, practice evaluation, and individual and social system assessment and intervention. They provide detailed case studies and directions for accessing rapid assessment instruments throughout the text. The also include programs, resources, and corresponding websites that link to appropriate services.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

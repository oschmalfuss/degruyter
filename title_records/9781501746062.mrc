Although ancient literature has preserved information about the most famous Greek sculptors who worked in bronze, our perception of the art has been limited by the small number of extant originals from the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. there remain fewer than ten large cast bronze statues, a like number of bronze heads, an assortment of fragments, and some clay molds for casting.Carol Mattusch enriches our knowledge of this beloved but elusive art form in a comprehensive study of the style and techniques of bronze statuary during the Archaic (6th century B.C.) and Classical (5th century B.C.) periods.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

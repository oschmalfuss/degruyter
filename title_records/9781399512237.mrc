Scott Fitzgerald’s short stories published in American magazines between 1921 and 1924Brings together all of Fitzgerald’s magazine stories in the order they appeared in the American literary marketplace between 1921 - 1924Refocuses critical attention on the contexts where Fitzgerald was most read, the American magazine market, and helps the reader to visualize these spaces with the Image AppendixIntroduction by Advisory Editor, Jennifer Nolan, gives new details about the size, scope, and power of the American magazine market as the Jazz Age began and the considerable role of the magazines in this era of Fitzgerald’s careerNgram Appendix, by Editor Alexandra Mitchell, offers a new way to quantify Fitzgerald’s mastery of the language and mood of his timeAs we celebrate the centennials of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s works, this volume offers a timely new approach to the short stories of the Poet Laureate of the Jazz Age. Foregrounding reception, this volume is the first to bring together and reprint all of the magazine texts of the eighteen stories Fitzgerald published in American magazines between 1921 and 1924 – replicating, as closely as possible, the version of Fitzgerald’s texts that were available to American audiences. Drawing attention to the nine different magazines where his stories appeared, this collection emphasises the size, scope and power of the American magazine market as the Jazz Age began, and situates Fitzgerald’s works within the contexts where they were read by his largest audiences and where his reputation as a social historian was created, appreciated and solidified.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

In the past, books on experimental design focused almost entirely on manufacturing problems. In contrast, although this book is relevant to manufacturing and includes useful examples in that area, its emphasis is on applications to marketing and service operations. The authors provide a fresh and practical treatment of the key topics in designing and analyzing experiments. Testing in the business world is commonplace, and the usual approach is to change one factor at a time while holding other factors constant. This approach may seem logical and appealing, but, as the authors explain, it is highly inefficient, and may lead to wrong conclusions. The better method, the authors propose, is to test all factors simultaneously. Doing so not only reduces the costs of experimenting but also provides the decision-maker with better information. Throughout the book, the authors illustrate concepts with practical examples. In addition, the book includes a set of 13 separate real-world cases based on the actual implementation of experimental design methods.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

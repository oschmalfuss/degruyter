The topic is of special interest because of the continuing proliferation of new actors on the international stage and the paucity of published studies of their foreign affairs. It is also particularly timely because of the increasing importance of the Persian Gulf and of oil in world politics. Recognizing that international politics exercises a major influence on the diplomacy of a small state by imposing constraints as well as offering options, the author argue that the success of Iranian diplomacy in achieving a balanced international posture and a strong regional policy is primarily a result of two factors: the gradual transformation of Soviet policy toward Iran from expansionism to accommodation, and Iran's enhanced economic and political capabilities. A perceptive interpretation of the international political environment and a realistic recognition of the constraints and opportunities involved have redounded to the advantage of Iran. Consequently Iran has been able to use its proximity to a Great Power with a long history of expansionist aspirations in order to pursue a posture of de facto nonalignment without abandoning a generally pro-Western orientation. The authors have designed their book to provide a detailed case study of Iranian foreign policy within an analytical framework conductive to theorizing about the foreign policy of other comparable small states. Previous treatments of the subject have ignored insights afforded by contemporary international relations, and have been largely historical and descriptive. The present volume, taking a different approached, should serve both the specialist on Iranian affairs and the student of international relations and comparative foreign policy.

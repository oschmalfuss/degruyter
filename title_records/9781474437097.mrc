Both the resurgence of Islamist politics and the political, social and intellectual upheaval which accompanied the Arab Spring challenge us to re-examine the interaction between the pre-modern Islamic tradition and modern supporters of continuity, reform and change in Muslim communities.This book does exactly that, raising questions regarding issues about which other Muslim intellectuals and thinkers have been silent. These include – among others – current religious practice vs the Islamic ideal; the many additions to the original revelation; the veracity of the Prophet’s biography and his sayings; the development of Sufism; and historical and ideological influences on Islamic thought.Key FeaturesMakes available in English an important contribution to modern Muslim thought from a prominent Egyptian thinkerLooks at how current religious practice conforms (or not) to the Islamic ideal when Islam was first revealedExplores the relationship between core, inner religious values and ritualistic practicesEngages critically with the sources by using historical, literal and logical criticism  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

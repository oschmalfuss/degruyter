Popular music, in particular, is considered to be an effective form of subversion and resistance under oppressive circumstances. But as Nomi Dave shows us in The Revolution’s Echoes, the opposite is also true—music can often support, rather than challenge, the powers that be. Examining fifty years of history in Guinea, Dave introduces readers to the music supporting the authoritarian regime of former president Sékou Touré, and to the musicians who, even long after his death, have continued to praise dictators and avoid dissent. Dave shows that this isn’t just the result of state manipulation—even in the absence of coercion, musicians and their audiences take real pleasure in musical praise of leaders. Time and again, whether in traditional music or in newer genres such as rap, Guinean musicians have celebrated state power and authority. With The Revolution’s Echoes, Dave insists that we must grapple with the uncomfortable truth that some forms of music choose to support authoritarianism, generating new pleasures and new politics in the process.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 21.

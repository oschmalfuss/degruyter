This question is examined through a series of problems concerning unjust law that arose with respect to slavery in nineteenth-century America.“Cover’s book is splendid in many ways. His legal history and legal philosophy are both first class. . . . This is, for a change, an interdisciplinary work that is a credit to both disciplines.”-Ronald Dworkin, Times Literary Supplement“Scholars should be grateful to Cover for his often brilliant illumination of tensions created in judges by changing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century jurisprudential attitudes and legal standards. . . An exciting adventure in interdisciplinary history.”-Harold M. Hyman, American Historical Review“A most articulate, sophisticated, and learned defense of legal formalism. . . Deserves and needs to be widely read.”-Don Roper, Journal of American History“An excellent illustration of the way in which a burning moral issue relates to the American judicial process. The book thus has both historical value and a very immediate importance.”-Edwards A. Stettner, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science “A really fine book, an important contribution to law and to history.”-Louis H.

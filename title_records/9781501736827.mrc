He first explores how history as a professional discipline has changed over the past century. In the process, he treats the relationship of the historian's craft to American nationalism, reflects on the uses and value of historical significance of historiography as a measure of cultural change. He shows how Americans have manipulated the past for social and ideological reasons, how memories of the national and regional past have conflicted with the realities of historicalo experience, and how Americans have simultaneously become more present-minded while professing a deeper concern for their heritage. Finally, Kammen explains why he believes historians should pursue new approaches to American cultural history, and to state and local history as well.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

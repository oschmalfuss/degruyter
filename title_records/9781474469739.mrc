This important collection examines various aspects of his argument and expands the discussion beyond the text to explore wider issues at the centre of contemporary debates about the nature and theories of distributive justice. It brings together responses from a wide range of Barry's critics including feminists, utilitarians, mutual advantage theorists, care theorists and anti-contractarians.Suitable for both undergraduates and academics working in political and legal theory, this text serves as an ideal companion volume to Barry's work. The expansion of each contributor's focus beyond the issues raised by Barry means this text also stands as a contribution to political thought in its own right.Key FeaturesPaperback edition published to meet demand for this book from lecturers teaching political philosophy, ethics, and justice coursesIncludes detailed response to his critics from Brian BarryFeatures contributions from leading international figures in the field including Richard Arneson, David Gauthier, Russell Hardin, Susan Mendus and Albert WealeServes both as a companion to Barry's Justice as Impartiality and as a new contribution to political thoughtOffers an important reply to Barry by David Gauthier in which he defends his mutual advantage theory of morality  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

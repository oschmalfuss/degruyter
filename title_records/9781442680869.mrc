In the early 1990s, Banks and Mangan implemented a community-development, action-research project designed to rebuild and revitalize the town. This book illustrates the success of local citizens in the revival of their community and the discovery of a nascent network of mutual support among neighbours.The authors demonstrate how inquiry, education, and action-research can combine to form an effective model for engaged ethnographic analysis. Their application of narrative inquiry to community-based research is new, and their conclusion that externally generated, imposed structure impedes community autonomy and responsibility is well supported. The book significantly expands the established theoretical framework of action-research and offers an exciting alternative to existing models of community development.The Company of Neighbours demonstrates a valuable approach for researchers, social workers, educators, and geographers in facilitating the collective efforts of people in local communities to shape the conditions of their own lives. With a new farmer's market, a museum in the renovated train station, youth programs, and an invigorated Business Improvement Association, Hespeler is well on its way to a new identity.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

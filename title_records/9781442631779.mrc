It examines the consequences of the withdrawal of defence expenditures on industry and employment, and suggests how defence spending could be replaced in order to create new civil demand. The book provides precise and objective statistical analysis, which is much needed in this field. Both method and conclusions will be of interest in all countries to those concerned with public policy and the future of mankind.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

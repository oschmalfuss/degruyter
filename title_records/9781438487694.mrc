In recent years, leading higher education systems have engaged in transforming the way they work, scaling best practices, leveraging data and analytics, and creating platforms to optimize and personalize these systems for increasingly diverse students. In Higher Education Systems Redesigned, leaders of these efforts share their insights into "systemness" and how to facilitate sustainable change in a system setting while navigating and leveraging tensions between campus and system priorities. Highlighting examples of successful realignment of these priorities with a focus on contextualized design and implementation, the book charts a shift in the aim of systems. Rather than perpetuating existing norms as they have traditionally done, systems are taking measures to spark innovation across campuses and use evidence-based practices to foster student access and completion rates, better serve communities, and drive social mobility and economic growth. Each chapter concludes with a list of takeaways to guide other system leaders and administrators. One of the few recent examinations of higher education systems, Higher Education Systems Redesigned offers a theoretical and practical framework for how systems can continually evolve.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

The book is written for readers who have a minimal background in mathematics and economics and so the materials listed in the bibliographies have been chosen for their accessibility to such readers. References to relevant papers of a more technical nature are indicated in notes in each reference. Unlike existing texts, which usually concentrate on regional impact or evaluation analysis, Regional Economic Impact Analysis and Project Evaluation offers an extensive introduction to both these subjects, since both are critical to the study and practice of regional economic analysis. Two case studies, intended as illustrations of practical applications, are included in each of the six chapters that deal with specific principles or techniques. While many of the case studies and much of the literature cited in the bibliographies is Canadian, a substantial portion is from the United States and Great Britain, demonstrating that the principles and techniques discussed in this book are universally applicable.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

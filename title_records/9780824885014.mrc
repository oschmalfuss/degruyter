Within minutes after bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, a well-rehearsed disaster relief plan went into full operation. Thousands of volunteers of all ages and races toiled selflessly to bring order out of chaos.Even before the pall of smoke had died away, air raid trenches had begun to crisscross lawns. By nightfall, windows were blacked out, curfew stilled the darkness, and citizen-soldiers stood girded for a last-ditch fight.During the following tension-ridden days, the entire populace was fingerprinted and inoculated; gas masks were issued and evacuation kits prepared. Barbed wire entanglements, taped windows, sandbag barricades, camouflaged buildings, gas alarms-everywhere were constant, grim reminders of total war. No other American community felt the tensions and shapeless fears the Islands knew during those first months after Pearl Harbor.And, as the Pacific war progressed, no other American community felt its impact so much as Hawaii. Headquarters area, training, staging, and supply area, repair base-Hawaii served as the springboard of the Pacific offensive. Hordes of troops and war workers deluged the Islands; land and buildings were taken over by the armed forces. Controls of every type plagued businesses and individuals. No phase of Island living was left untouched by the war.Hawaii's War Years, 1941-1945, the official history of Hawaii's dramatic part in World War II, is a comprehensive, unbiased account based on material collected over a six-year period by the Hawaii War Records Depository. Written by an Island newspaperwoman with the proper perspective for a subject of such scope, the book does not attempt to render judgments. It is primarily a book of record, a straightforward presentation of facts.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

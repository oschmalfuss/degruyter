It is associated with the emergence of intriguing figures—such as the 'new woman' and 'uranian'; with contradictory impulses—of decadence and decay on the one hand, and of experiment and renewal, on the other; as well as with unprecedented intercultural exchange, especially between Britain and France. The 22 newly-commissioned essays collected here re-examine some of the key concepts taken to define the fin de siècle, while also introducing hitherto overlooked cultural phenomena into the frame, such as the importance of humanitarianism. The impact of recent research in material culture is explored, particularly how the history of the book and the history of performance culture is changing our understanding of this period. A wide range of cultural activities is discussed—from participation in avant-garde theatre to interior decoration and from the writing of poetry to political and religious activism. Together, the essays provide new scholarly insights into British fin de siècle and enrich our understanding of this complex period, while paying particular attention to the importance of regionalism.Key FeaturesContains a re-examination of some of the key concepts taken to define the fin de siècle, such as Decadence, while also introducing new concepts into the frame, such as the importance, at the time, of humanitarianisExamines the significance of the fin de siècle in Scotland and Ireland, as well as in some regions of EnglandExamines how attention to material culture, and particularly to the history of the book and the history of performance culture, is changing our understanding of this periodDiscusses a range of cultural activities, from participation in avant-garde theatre to interior decoration, and from the writing of poetry to political and religious activism  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

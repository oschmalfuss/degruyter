The same was true in the past. Monetary stabilization became as important issue after 1870, when silver depreciated rapidly against gold and Western countries switched to the gold standard. Colonial Indonesia followed the Netherlands in this respect. On the ardent advice of N.P van den Berg, then president of the central bank, the Java Bank, it was the first Asian country to stabilize its currency against gold, in this case against the gold-based Dutch guilder. Van den Berg was a prominent proponent of monetary stabilization and was well known for his contributions to he dicussion about currency systems and monetary policy in the government of British India, which was at the time exploring ways to achieve stabilization of the rupee. Both the arguments and the wealth of data in the reprint of this very rare book will be of interest to historians of Southeast Asia.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

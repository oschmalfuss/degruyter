The Islamic Revolution in Iran, the election of the Justice and Development Party in Turkey and the coming to power of Islamists, albeit briefly, after the Arab Spring, has changed the political landscape in the Middle East and has ramifications for the entire Muslim World. Yet the continuing success of these parties depends on their record on economic development and employment creation. Are their economic policies different from those of their autocratic predecessors? Have they been influenced by the writings of academic Islamist economists? This book looks at the impact of Islamic teaching on public economic policy and asks how Islamic economics differs from mainstream micro and macroeconomics. Key FeaturesLooks at how Islamic values can influence choices made by businesses and governmentsAsks whether Shari'ah teaching affects taxation and social welfare policiesAssesses the potential of Islamic economics to provide an alternative to a capitalist economic system and looks at the implications for international economic relationsIndividual chapters evaluate the economic successes and failures of OIC member states (Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Tunisia and Turkey) and their changing status in the global economic order  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

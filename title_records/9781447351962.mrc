Since 2014, teachers in England have been required to promote these values in schools to all pupils. What are the implications of this for teachers, pupils and the rest of us? Discussing a broad mix of issues – citizenship, diversity, social class, ethnicity, religion, counter-extremism, affect, and community cohesion – this book discusses the political, social, cultural and educational contexts in which teachers are promoting these values. Drawing on observations of teaching, as well as teachers’ views and experiences, it analyses how teachers make sense of the mandatory promotion of FBV, and what ideas of citizenship and identity they offer to their pupils.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

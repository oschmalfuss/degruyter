Drawn from holdings in the Frye archives - holograph notebooks, typed notes, and typescripts - these writings have been largely inaccessible to Frye scholars until now. Some of the contents of this volume, Frye's early fiction, for example, will come as a surprise to those acquainted primarily with his published criticism. All of his fables and dialogues are included here, as are a half-dozen sets of notes in which he speculates on forms of fiction and various literary projects he planned to one day undertake. These miscellaneous writings offer further evidence of Frye's fertile mind, quick wit, expansive imagination, and eloquence. Frye always claimed that the process of writing was for him a search for proper formulas through which to communicate. The material in this volume, which seldom fails to instruct and delight, discloses the process of that search.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 08.

Europeanizing Greece explores the developments that resulted from Greece's European integration between 1989 and 1999, which played a crucial role in shaping the country's current conditions.Focusing on changes made to the Greek administrative and political system based on EU structural policy, Nancy Vamvakas contends that EU involvement was not the only reason why these modifications were implemented. Vamvakas points out serious flaws in the Greek system and demonstrates how Greece's approach to reform has been inextricably linked to the perceived level of crises. Europeanizing Greece serves as a perceptive case study of the EU's continual enlargement and resulting regional challenges.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

He addresses important questions such as whether words are able to capture the world (nouns); whether the properties of things, such as colours, are real (adjectives); and how we can think about the world as process (verbs). Primarily using the work of the innovative British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, but also incorporating the ideas of Gilles Deleuze, John Dewey and Luce Irigaray, he argues that viewing both the world and language as ‘in process’ can help reframe and move beyond some enduring problems and shed new light for future research.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

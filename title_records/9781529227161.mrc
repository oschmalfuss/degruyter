That means teaching migration through the prism of critical pedagogy is a political and ethical necessity. This book invites readers to examine their own relationships with migration, ethics, politics and power. It encourages teachers, students and practitioners to think critically about their position in relation to the knowledge they both bring and gain. With pedagogical features that provide space for reflection and discussion, this is a transformative resource in reshaping how we teach and learn about migration.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

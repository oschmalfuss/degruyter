Whether serious or not, Foucault's prediction has had enough of an impact to raise concern about the potential "deification" of this enormously influential French philosopher. Seeking to counter such tendencies toward hagiography-not unknown, particularly since Deleuze's death-Ian Buchanan has assembled a collection of essays that constitute a critical and focused engagement with Deleuze and his work.Originally published as a special issue of South Atlantic Quarterly (Summer 1997), this volume includes essays from some of the most prominent American, Australian, British, and French scholars and translators of Deleuze's writing. These essays, ranging from film, television, art, and literature to philosophy, psychoanalysis, geology, and cultural studies, reflect the broad interests of Deleuze himself. Providing both an introduction and critique of Deleuze, this volume will engage those readers interested in literary and cultural theory, philosophy, and the future of those areas of study in which Deleuze worked.Contributors.

There did, however, seem to be a need for a record of the major landmarks in the development of printing from its inception to the present day. From the myriad details and dates of some five centuries, there could be compiled a work fo many volumes; the strength and the value of Annals of Printing lies in its selection of salient information into one compact volume. The work has been achieved by the collaboration of two authorities: W. Turner Berry, who has written and edited several books during his long years as the Librarian of the St. Bride Institute in London, and who has brought his great experience to bear in treating the period from 1800 to the present time; and H. Edmund Poole, who has for over thirty years been associated with the practice and history of 'the trade' and who has been responsible for the period from the earliest days to 1800. By its nature, a book of separate entires cannot be said to have a plot or narrative, but to anybody concerned with printing, paper, publishing, music engraving, newspapers, trade unions, ink, block-making, and the evolution of the materials and techniques upon which printing depends, this will be an exciting book and one which it will be hard to lay aside. It is extensively illustrated throughout with reproductions of pages from books, machinery, portraits, type faces and other subjects which making a fascinating visual record.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

He joined the university four years after it opened when, having just received his doctorate from Harvard, he was appointed professor of biology and head of the department. For the next forty-sixty years he held several positions, including dean of arts and president of the university. During that time he was involved in making and implementing many important decisions, and in the course of his work he formed close friendships with nearly all the outstanding people who have been connected with the university over the years. Because of his long service to the university and the fund of information he has accumulated, Dr. Thompson is well qualified to write a personal history of the institution. In this memoir the author has done more than merely recount the historical facts as recorded in official documents; he goes behind the scenes to give the background of those events. He explains the reasons for decisions and actions, and examines the give and take of personal relationships and the influence of personal characteristics. An informative and entertaining look at the history of a university, this volume will be fascinating reading for everyone interested in education, in the history of the west, or in the development of Canadian institutions.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

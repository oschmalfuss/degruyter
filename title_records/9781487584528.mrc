Economic Planning in a Democratic Society? -- tIn no country where private enterprise is dominant could central planning be successful without a close and trustful co-operation between government, private enterprise and all interests concerned -- tPlanning of the development council type is consistent with the principles of a free enterprise economy. Planning of the planning commission type is necessarily at variance with free enterprise principles -- tPrivate implementation of the Plan (in France) involves, or at least threatens to involve, co-operative arrangements among rivals which would be at odds with American tradition -- tPart 2. The Nature of Economic Planning -- tPlanning is not good industrial relations. The search for better industrial relations is not any the less important an economic technique. But it is a different technique -- t...we define the essence of planning as the contrived co-ordination co-ordination of economic activity by means of a centralized initiative -- tPlanning of the type currently practised in some countries might even retard economic growth . ... -- tThe basic ideas of economic planning nowadays are integration and co-ordination rather than planning as such. -- tIn many aspects the economic activities of a nation may be pursued in much the same way that businesses are operated. -- tThere are two kinds of economic planning. One sort is the planning of final demands and the other sort is the planning of total output -- tPart 3. What Kind of Planning for Canada? -- tWhat can we learn that is of relevance for Canada from the experience of other democratic, industrially advanced nations which have established some form of economic planning organization? -- tPlanning a foreign-controlled economy with a federal constitution is a challenge that can be met only after a drastic revolution has taken place in the minds of the people -- tWe have accepted from Europe the lesson that planning need not imply any antithesis between socialism and free enterprise. -- tLet us at all cost steer clear of the kind of regimentation associated with the centrally directed and planned economy -- tEffective economic planning is more likely to be handicapped in the future by deeply ingrained prejudices about what governments should or should not do than by our inability to determine what correct economic policy should be -- tNo nation can fill the needs of its people and meet its commitments to the world in the twentieth century unless it develops democratic economic planning as a nation -- tWhether we like it or not our planning must recognize the interests of others, particularly the investors abroad who own so much of our industry .... -- tSelected Bibliography -- tBoard of Directors -- tC.I.P.A.

The articles suggested a division into three sections. Thus Part 1 contains the articles which centre on the title or ,the compatibility of economic planning with free enterprise; Part 2 those which centre more on the definition or the nature of economic planning; and Part 3 the articles whose authors apply the general principles primarily to the question of what kind of planning for Canada?  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

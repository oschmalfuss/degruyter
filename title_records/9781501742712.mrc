It is not a conventional biography of King Mongkut or a history of his reign; rather, the author sketches the man in his many facets, furnishing a factual outline, but applying the color from the King's own writings-through which his personality and character shine so clearly-and from other contemporary sources. Many of these appear in English for the first time.As ruler and diplomat, as philosopher and scientist, as monk and head of a large family, Mongkut showed powers of mind and spirit extraordinary in any age. As here presented, he is even more remarkable than the caricature of him depicted in some recent popular accounts.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

This is the first full-length study of the lyrics, and includes detailed analyses of such well-known poems as Love Among the Ruins, Two in the Campagna, A Serenade at the Villa, A Toccata of Galuppi's, By the Fireside, and James Lee's Wife. Eleanor Cook explores Browning's use of repeated images and themes in the lyrics, examines these patterns in other poems and in his letters, and analyses their growth and change in all his work. She demonstrates how the lyrics may be linked with Browning's other work and shows something of his essential artistic unity. His imaginary is found to be more consistent and complex than is usually assumed. Students of Browning will find this work stimulating and instructive, while lovers of Browning will read it with pure pleasure. The reader will return to many of the poems with a rciher sense of their continuing vitality. In an earlier form this study was awarded the first A.S.P. Woodhouse Prize by the University of Toronto.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

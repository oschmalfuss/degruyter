Universities do not devote enough attention to undergraduate education, the charge goes, or they pursue unnecessary research, or they award doctoral degrees that focus too narrowly and take too long to complete. What have these institutions done to provoke such criticism and why has financial support from both public and private sectors eroded? In The American University, distinguished scholars and administrators address these issues and suggest ways in which research universities can respond to current and future challenges.The challenges are complex, and the contributors are willing to redefine fundamental objectives to rebuild public trust. Each essay addresses one of the issues on which the future of American research universities may pivot. What responsibilities does a university have to enhance social mobility? Why have the research partnerships between government and academia broken down? How comprehensive and how effective is undergraduate and graduate teaching? What are realistic prospects for the humanities and social sciences at the university, and what are the prospects for science and technology?  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

In Part 1, the author discusses his thoughts on the cyber security industry and how those that operate within it should approach their role with the mindset of an artist. Part 2 explores the work of Sun Tzu’s The Art of War. The author analyses key sections and reviews them through the lens of cyber security and data protection to derive how his teachings can be used within the cyber security industry. Although Tzu’s book on military strategy, tactics and operations was written more than 2,000 years ago, The Art of Cyber Security – A practical guide to winning the war on cyber crime reflects on how relevant Tzu’s words are for today’s technological era. This book celebrates the individuals who are striving to protect us in an ever-expanding technological era. Data and technology are so important to our lives, that protecting people who use technology is incredibly important. The professionals working to protect children, adults and corporations have a tough job, and this book celebrates their work while advocating ways for improving cyber security services and fighting cyber crime. This book will challenge your thinking and force you to approach cyber security and data protection from theoretical, philosophical, strategic, tactical and operational perspectives.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

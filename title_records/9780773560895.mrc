"[Hare] provides us with a clear concept of open-mindedness and shows why that attitude is central to our view of education . for those who are interested in the concept of education or values or moral education, and those who want to see how open-mindedness relates to important concepts such as rationality, neutrality, indoctrination . recommended to all who are concerned with education, not just teachers and teacher educators. The language is absolutely clear and free of pretentious jargon, the arguments are rigorous, cogent, and easy to follow, and the organization of the book is truly exemplary."

During the Gulf War, as politicians advocated positions and strategies, they made simplistic comparisons with the '60s. Such comparisons reinforced our need to understand that decade more clearly. With these papers Tischler brings together a group of scholars from a variety of disciplines, including American Studies, anthropology, film studies, history, literature, sociology, and theater. She notes how their contributions, taken separately and together, transcend the "good sixties/bad sixties" typology that has pervaded past analyses of the period. Several authors deal with movement leaders and great events, but the majority write about lesser-known events and people, to add depth and balance to our understanding of the decade. 1. Multi-disciplinary collection 2. Emphasis on less well-known events of the period 3. Presents balanced picture of the decade  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

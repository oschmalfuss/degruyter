Given the growing reach and significance of these alliances, there is now a critical need for an informed and balanced analysis of their achievements, their progress, and their potential. In Corporate Responsibility Coalitions, the first book to chronicle the subject, David Grayson and Jane Nelson explore the past, present, and future of these coalitions. They consider the emergence of new models of collective corporate action over the past four decades; the increasing number of these coalitions, their diversity and complexity; and how they network with each other and a broader set of institutions that promote sustainable capitalism. Drawing on their global study, the authors light the way for the future development of these influential alliances. In addition, they provide in-depth profiles of the most strategic, effective, and long-standing coalitions.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

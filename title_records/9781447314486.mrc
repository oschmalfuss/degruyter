The short guide to working with children and young people is an accessible introduction into the main concepts, developments and policy related to this exciting area of work. Divided into two parts, the opening chapters prepare readers to think about work with children and young people by providing an overview of key theoretical perspectives related to the field. The second part focuses on work with children and young people by exploring the roles of some of the key practitioners at each stage and developing an understanding of what they do. This unique book provides a clear, concise and accessible overview of the subject and allows readers to make more informed choices in their career pathway. It provides a key starting point for relevant undergraduate degree courses as well as for people considering working in this field, and a valuable reference point for existing practitioners and volunteers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

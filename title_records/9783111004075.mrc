Situating Scandinavian Poetry in the Computational Network environment investigates how heterogeneous forms of poetry in Scandinavia interact with and work in a digital media environment, how digital programmable and network media intervene with and shape new poetic forms or remediate older forms of poetry, and how digital and digitalized poetry through its self-reflexivity sheds light on digital media technology and its role for poetry and potentially for literature and aesthetics more in general. In doing so, it also argues for the importance of close reading poetry in digital media. It includes an historical and theoretical approach to poetry in digital media and analysis of poetic works in Scandinavia. The book is written within the framework of posthumanism and what N. Katerine Hayles calls "technogenesis", and makes up the argument that contemporary poetry constitutes and is constituted by a computational network environment of human and non-human subjects, wherein poems travels in an egalitarian media ecology . The book is relevant for researchers and students in the field of poetry, students and researchers in the field of literary studies, media studies and digital culture studies, and teachers interested in presenting newer forms of poetry for their students.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

While White middle-class families tend to be the focus of autism research and services, A Thousand Worries tells the stories of fifteen Black mothers of autistic sons, including the author’s own story. Interweaving her personal experience and research findings, Jeannine E. Dingus-Eason examines the intersections of race, class, and gender and the complexities of parenting, care, and services for Black autism mothers, or BAMs. Dingus-Eason shows how BAMs leverage their faith, support networks, and knowledge of autism to advocate for their sons in cultural and sociopolitical contexts that consistently dehumanize, criminalize, and adultify Black boys. A Thousand Worries will give families, scholars, and practitioners in education, social work, human services, and health insight into not only BAMs' many concerns and challenges but also their strengths, strategies, and abiding love. At times moving, uplifting, funny, and raw, their testimonies illuminate the power dynamics between parents and providers, the value of supportive partnerships and mutual trust, and the need for culturally responsive services.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

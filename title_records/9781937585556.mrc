As many as five million adults in the U.S. have Alzheimer’s disease today, and that number will continue to grow as the population ages. Alzheimer’s Disease provides straight-forward answers to common questions about the disease. Using a question–answer format, the book is designed to give caregivers, family members, and friends of people with Alzheimer’s disease easy access to the practical information they need to understand the symptoms, its treatment, and how to preserve quality of life. Although Alzheimer’s disease was identified more than 100 years ago, it is only within the last 30 years that research into the disease has gained momentum. Much is left to discover, including the exact biological changes that cause it and how to reverse, slow, or prevent it.Features:•Questions and answers about the medical definition/descriptions of Alzheimer’s disease; the source/causes; details of symptoms; available treatments, etc.•Covers symptoms, diagnosis, drug and non-drug treatments, care giving, social issues, and more•Resources including Web sites, articles, blogs, etc. from NIH, CDC, YouTube, FDA, and more•Includes a companion disc with articles, animations, color figures from the book, Web links, etc.eBook Customers: Companion files are available for downloading with order number/proof of purchase by writing to the publisher at info@merclearning.com.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

It provides a unique perspective on the events that roiled the campus during this period-a period in which the author, Richard Lyman, served as the university's vice president, provost, and then president. In a cross between memoir and history, the book guides us through major cases of arson, including the destruction of the president's office, the notorious "Cambodia Spring" of 1970-when dozens of students and police were injured-and the forced resignation of another Stanford president after just nineteen months in office. Remarkably, Stanford's prestige and academic strength grew unabated throughout this time of crisis. How this came to pass is the central theme of Stanford in Turmoil.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 15.

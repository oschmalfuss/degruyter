Focusing on both canonical and less familiar poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley, and Byron, Claridge draws on Lacanian theory to explore Romantic desire in relationship to the infant's radical yearning for an Eden before the advent of language. The Romantics, she asserts, attempt the impossible: to transcend the medium of words and reattain that original paradise of silence, but with their poetic voices intact.Claridge perceives textual desire as a discursive strategy for staving off consummation and death. She suggests the ways in which Wordsworth, Shelley, and Byron made use of the philosophically marginalized position of women to support their attempt to locate an "essential" subjectivity. In spite of the highly personal linguistic models that each poet developed, Claridge finds a pervasive similarity of psychological contours: in every case, the poet writes of a freedom outside of language, even as he insists on the enduring need to write yet again.Romantic Potency will be challenging reading for literary theorists, scholars and students of English Romanticism and of eighteenth-century literature, and others interested in psychoanalytic approaches to literature.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

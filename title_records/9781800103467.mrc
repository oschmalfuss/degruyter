The University of Rochester Medical Center's response to community needs in this field began in 1947. This book describes the history of its Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, written by the only two chiefs the division has had. The narrative traces the first effort to provide diagnostic service to parents of affected children and describes the emergence of a full program of interdisciplinary services, education of future leaders, community-based consultation, and research. It shows how the division's growth was molded by changing needs in the region and the world. It also tells the story of how a multidisciplinary program can emerge and thrive in a research-oriented medical center and serve as a bridge between a university and its community partners. Finally, it underscores the time-consuming process of program development, including building trust, acquiring needed resources, and maintaining the highest quality of programming during both good and difficult times.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

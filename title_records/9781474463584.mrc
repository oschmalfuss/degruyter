The contributors present a radical and much-needed intervention that will interest all academics engaged with creative practice research. It also contains one of Thomas Elsaesser’s final pieces of writing, a unique personal account of the making of his first and only film The Sun Island.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

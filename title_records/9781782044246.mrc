Here she takes up various topics of perennial interest: how music awakens and even creates memories, what "interpretation" really means, what effect daily practice has on the character, whether playing from memory is a burden or a liberation, and why the piano is the right tool for the job. She pays homage to the influence of remarkable teachers, asks what it takes for long-term chamber groups to survive the strains of professional life, and explores the link between music and health. Once again, her aim is to provide insight into the motives and experiences of classical performers. In this fourth book she also describes some of the challenges facing classical musicians in today's society, and considers why this kind of long-form music means so much to those who love it.SUSAN TOMES has won a number of international awards as a performer and recording artist, and in 2013 was awarded the Cobbett Medal for distinguished services to chamber music. For fifteen years she was the pianist of Domus, and for seventeen years she was the pianist of the Florestan Trio, one of the world's leading piano trios. She is the author of three previous books: Beyond the Notes (2004) and Out of Silence (2010), both published by Boydell, and A Musician's Alphabet (2006). She gives masterclasses, writes and presents radio programmes on music, and sits on international competition juries. Her blog on www.susantomes.com has a loyal following.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Abnormal expression and activities of serine proteases have been linked to the pathogenesis of many diseases. The book presents correlation between serine proteases and human diseases. It helps the reader understand classification, catalytic mechanism and types of serine proteases and their role in human disease pathogenesis at mechanistic level. The chapters explain the role of serine proteases in various diseases including respiratory disorders and cancer. It also covers the therapeutic importance of serine proteases as drug target and explains the mechanistic insights of serine proteases inhibitors. Serine protease are known to play crucial role in biological processes but disturbance in their equilibrium can result in serious health conditions. To maintain homeostasis, serine protease inhibitors come in action and inhibit proteases. Several serine protease inhibitors have been identified and many more are being designed as novel compounds for inhibitions of proteases that provide management of comorbidities. Therefore, this book will serve as a useful reference for students and researchers to understand physiological role of serine proteases and their association with initiation and progression of human diseases. It will also help to develop some strategies to develop serine proteases inhibitors as drug target of serine proteases at cellular and molecular level.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

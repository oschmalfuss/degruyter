Adding a new perspective on the formation of Scotland’s national identity, the book documents a century-long, often heated debate regarding the extent of Roman influence north of Hadrian’s Wall. By exploring the lives and writings of antiquarians, poets and Enlightenment thinkers, it aims to uncover the political, patriotic and intellectual influences which fuelled this debate. Classical Caledonia casts light on a rarely discussed aspect of Scotland’s historiography, one which played a vital role in establishing early modern notions of ‘Scottishness’ at a time when Scotland was coming to terms with radical and traumatic changes to its position within Britain and the wider world.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

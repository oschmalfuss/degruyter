And whether it's an expensive product recall or a deadly airplane crash, any crisis can turn into chaos-unless there's an effective management response plan in place. All Crises Are Global provides the basics of an effective crisis-management plan. Marion Pinsdorf gives managers the tools and sensitivity to deal with the catastrophic effects of a crisis-whether it touches on the organization itself, the media, competitors, partners, government, or victims. Filled with real-world examples of successes and failures (from the Arthur Andersen meltdown to the attacks of September 11), Pinsdorf shows how to plan for, manage, monitor, and mitigate the effects of crises large and small. Spread instantaneously to a litigious world by global media, crises can no longer be contained or controlled-only anticipated and managed. Executives can manage the impact of even large-scale events by quickly taking responsibility for the human and financial costs of an organization's mistakes. Pinsdorf provides techniques for building smart organizations that react quickly before problems escalate into crises. Practical, tested, and wise, this book helps all managers look for trouble spots and deal with them effectively. "Marion Pinsdorf . . . is able to counsel today's harried business leaders from perspectives no one else can offer. By combining what we can learn from the past with modern techniques and creative problem solving strategies, Dr. Pinsdorf shows how we can find new positive ways to take some of the 'hiss' out of the word crisis."-John W.

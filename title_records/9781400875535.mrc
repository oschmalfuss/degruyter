The revolutionary spirit of 1848 had faded; much of the country was again under foreign control. Her political leaders were in exile, but they could not dismiss their dreams of a united Italy. Raymond Grew, in his account of the Italian National Society, shows the part that the Society had in realizing these dreams, and presents fresh material on the climactic years of the Risorgimento—who participated in it, what issues were involved, and how unification was accomplished. Drawing upon unpublished materials from archives and libraries throughout Europe, the author presents a comprehensive picture of the social, political, and intellectual climate of the period in which Italy became a nation.Originally published in 1963.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

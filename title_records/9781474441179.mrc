With a particular focus on operations in the Balkans and the Middle East, it offers a granular understanding of the motivations and ideals that informed Smiley’s commitment to covert action and intelligence, both during the Second World War and in the early Cold War era.Through extensive uses of primary sources including exclusive interviews with Colonel Smiley, his family and a number of key associates, Clive Jones crafts a detailed study of a man who proudly operated in the shadows for his country, while also addressing the wider issues of morality, accountability and control of clandestine operations.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

He discusses first the representation formula and then treats its application to the multiplicity problem, classes of processes with multiplicity N= 1, normal or Gaussian processes. He concludes with a discussion of problems of estimation for a normal process. A distinguished mathematician, Harald Cramer has been President of the University of Stockholm and Chancellor of the Swedish Universities. He is a member of many professional societies, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Originally published in 1971.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

This evolution can be seen in the widened role of the Self-Defence Force (SDF) in shaping Japan’s security priorities, as well as its proactive contribution to regional and international security. Focusing on four key case studies – international peacekeeping in 1992, regional defence in 1997–99, global missions in 2003–05, and collective self-defence in 2014–15 – the author argues that the Japanese security policymaking elite achieved security policy expansion by utilizing external military crises as policy windows, inflating and deflating threat elements to circumvent the constraints and justify the implementation of security policy initiatives.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

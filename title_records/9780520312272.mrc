Moody. That intellectual debt should be increased by this volume, which brings together the significant shorter studies and essays he wrote in the period 1933 - 1969. The collection should be particularly useful to the medievalist who finds it difficult to see where the detailed monographic research of the past half-century is leading. An initial lengthy study, on William of Auvergne and his treatise De anima, has not hitherto appeared in print. Five of the essays deal with late medieval physics and its relation to the mechanics of Galileo; others bear on medieval logic and philosophy of language, with reference to contemporary treatments of those subjects; and several studies are concerned with the historical and philosophical significance of Ockham, Buridan, and the via moderna of the fourteenth century. In his Introduction Moody discusses the development of his interests in medieval thoughts and offers some critical reflections on the essays.

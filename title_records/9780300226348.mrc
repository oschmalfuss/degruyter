In this fascinating book, Ray Moseley, himself a former foreign correspondent who encountered a number of these journalists in the course of his long career, mines the correspondents’ writings to relate, in an exhilarating parallel narrative, the events across every theater—Europe, Pearl Harbor, North Africa, and Japan—as well as the lives of the courageous journalists who doggedly followed the action and the story, often while embedded in the Allied armies. Moseley’s broad and intimate history draws on newly unearthed material to offer a comprehensive account both of the war and the abundance of individual stories and overlooked experiences, including those of women and African-American journalists, which capture the drama as it was lived by reporters on the front lines of history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

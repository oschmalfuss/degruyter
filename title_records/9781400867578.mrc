He is thus able to relate individual poems to Chaucer's view of himself as a writer, and to assess the internal evidence for a Chaucerian theory of fiction. Professor Burlin contends that a logic underlies Chaucer's aesthetic assumptions whose imaginative configuration appears both simple and inevitable in the context of his poetic development. The author first explores possible antecedents for the terms "experience" and auctoritee, and shows that this common antinomy provides the basis for dividing the poems into three groups.In the "poetic fictions," Chaucer speculates on the value of poetic activity, on the sources of its affect, and on its validity as a means of apprehension. The "philosophic fictions" concentrate on the epistemological aspect of literary activity. In a final group of poems, termed "psychological fictions," the poet explores the speaker's unspoken motives, as well as his pronounced intentions, in telling a tale.Originally published in 1977.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

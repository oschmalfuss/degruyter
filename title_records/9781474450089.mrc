Conley connects Donald Trump's populist style to his predecessors. Trump’s method of communication through social media obviously differs from previous candidates and presidents with populist platforms, but his themes – a disdain for elites, grassroots support, majoritarianism, anti-intellectual discourse and nativism – borrow variably from such figures as Andrew Jackson, Huey Long, Barry Goldwater and Ross Perot. As such, Trump’s approach to governance falls within a long tradition of populism dating to the 19th Century.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

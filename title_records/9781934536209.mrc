This site is important for its size, long settlement history that includes both the Bronze and Early Iron Age, and its artifacts, which reveal a local pottery tradition and contacts with other areas of Crete and the Aegean. In addition, Vrokastro is the only completely excavated site within the survey boundaries, and is thus the type-site for the new systematic survey recently undertaken in this area.Barbara Hayden provides new insights concerning the chronology of the settlement and its tombs, the nature of occupation at the site over 500 years, and commentary on burial practices and techniques. She reviews the evidence for contacts with other areas in Crete and the Aegean.This publication will be of use to those interested in ceramics of the period, settlement patterns, history, trade, burial customs, and metalworking. Following the first two catalogues of the Cretan collection of the Museum's Mediterranean Section, its conclusions are an integral part of the overall Vrokastro regional survey.University Museum Monograph, 113  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

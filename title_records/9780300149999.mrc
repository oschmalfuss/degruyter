But within a decade, Americans had built the first hotels-large and elegant structures that boasted private bedchambers and grand public ballrooms. This book recounts the enthralling history of the hotel in America-a saga in which politicians and prostitutes, tourists and tramps, conventioneers and confidence men, celebrities and salesmen all rub elbows. Hotel explores why the hotel was invented, how its architecture developed, and the many ways it influenced the course of United States history. The volume also presents a beautiful collection of more than 120 illustrations, many in full color, of hotel life in every era. Hotel explores these topics and more:· What it was like to sleep, eat, and socialize at a hotel in the mid-1800s· How hotelkeepers dealt with the illicit activities of adulterers, thieves, and violent guests· The stories behind America’s greatest hotels, including the Waldorf-Astoria, the Plaza, the Willard, the Blackstone, and the Fairmont· Why Confederate spies plotted to burn down thirteen hotels in New York City during the Civil War· How the development of steamboats and locomotives helped create a nationwide network of hotels· How hotels became architectural models for apartment buildings· The pivotal role of hotels in the civil rights movement  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

It offers intelligent and balanced insight into the contexts and work of a number of contemporary American Indian writers. Its careful discussion provides dear and sometimes breathtaking illumination into this literature that is at once tribal and modern, western and traditional, a literature that is the oldest and newest literature in America. --Paula Gunn Allen (Laguna), University of California, Berkeley   "This is a pioneering volume. Lincoln presents the writing of today's most gifted Native American authors, against an ethnographic background which should enable a growing number of readers to share his enthusiasm. Lincoln has lived with American Indians, knows them, and is respected by them; all this enhances his book." --William Bright, Editor, Language   "This is the most informed and insightful assessment of the best of modern Native American literature. Lincoln is sensitive to the tribal roots of this literature, so he is able to go beyond mere criticism to cultural contextualization. I found this study quite powerful in its scope, probing depth, imaginative sweep, and sensitivity of writing. Debate on the subject may well gather around Native American Renaissance for the rest of the decade." --Alfonso Ortiz (San Juan), University of New Mexico  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

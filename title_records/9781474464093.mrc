While contemporaries praised her vivid and energetic prose, a sustained and in-depth study of Quin has so far been absent from scholarly reassessment of this literary era. As the first comprehensive appraisal of her writing and life, this book redresses that critical neglect, aims to recuperate Quin as a key female experimental writer of the twentieth century, shows how the precarious possibility of her writing is its essential attribute, and demonstrates the lasting importance of her work. Its combination of scholarly analysis and archival expertise investigates her life, writing and forms of experimentation to convey precisely what is striking and significant about Quin.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

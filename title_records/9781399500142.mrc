In this book, Johanna Sellman analyses the changing aesthetic and political dimensions of Arabic exile literature and demonstrates how frameworks such as east-west cultural encounters, political commitment and modernist understandings of exile - which were dominant in 20th-century Arabic exile literature - have been giving way to writing that explores the dynamics of forced migration and the liminal spaces of borders and borderlands.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

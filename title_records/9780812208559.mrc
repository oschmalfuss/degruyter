Seven centuries later, this compendium of legal and customary information remains the foundation of modern Spanish law. In addition, its influence is notable in the law of Spain's former colonies, including Texas, California, and Louisiana. The work's extraordinary scope offers unparalleled insight into the social, intellectual, and cultural history of medieval Spain. Built on the armature of a law code, it is in effect an encyclopedia of medieval life.Long out of print, the English translation of Las Siete Partidas—first commissioned in 1931 by the American Bar Association—returns in a superior new edition. Editor and distinguished medieval historian Robert I. Burns, S.J., provides critical historical material in a new general Introduction and extensive introductions to each Partida. Jerry Craddock of the University of California, Berkeley, provides updated bibliographical notes, and Joseph O'Callaghan of Fordham University contributes a section on law in Alfonso's time.Las Siete Partidas is presented in five volumes, each available separately:The Medieval Church, Volume 1: The World of Clerics and Laymen (Partida I)Medieval Government, Volume 2: The World of Kings and Warriors (Partida II)The Medieval World of Law, Volume 3: Lawyers and Their Work (Partida III)Family, Commerce, and the Sea, Volume 4: The Worlds of Women and Merchants (Partidas IV and V)Underworlds, Volume 5: The Dead, the Criminal, and the Marginalized (Partidas VI and VII)  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

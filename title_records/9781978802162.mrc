The goal was to expand pride in intercollegiate athletics. Redirecting a program with clearer direction and strategic purpose brought encouraging results. Advocating for finer coaching and improved facilities, he and Rutgers achieved national honors in Division I sports. Unprecedented alumni interest and support for athletics swelled across the Rutgers community. His words and actions were prominent during a nationally-reported incident involving student athletes. When the Rutgers Women's Basketball team players were slandered by racist remarks from a popular radio talk show host, Mulcahy met it head on. With the coach and players, he set an inspiring example for defending character and values. Though Mr. Mulcahy left Rutgers in 2009, his memoir reflects continued devotion to intercollegiate athletics and student athletes. His insights for addressing several leading issues confronting Division I sports today offer guidelines for present and future athletic directors to follow.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

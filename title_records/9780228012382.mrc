A lawyer when he joined Bell Canada in 1966, he went on to build a telecommunications empire that spanned the continent, crossing paths with politicians, moguls, and philanthropists along the way.Beginning as Bell’s general counsel, de Grandpré quickly rose through the corporate ranks and became president in 1973. A few years later he created Bell Canada Enterprises, one of America’s largest telecommunications companies. A globally recognized manager and director, he has served on the boards of numerous companies, both in Canada and abroad. As generous as he is discreet, he is involved with several charities, including the Papillon Foundation, which helps disabled children. At McGill University, his alma mater, De Grandpré served as chancellor from 1984 to 1991 and is now governor emeritus and chancellor emeritus.Danielle Stanton and Hervé Anctil retrace the admirable career of this influential man whose life has spanned a century. Offering insight into the secrets of his success, Jean de Grandpré will inspire new generations of entrepreneurs.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

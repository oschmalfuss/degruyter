Exploring religion, ethnicity, racism, social class and deprivation, the book examines how British Muslims interact with the UK healthcare system and the subsequent marginalisation in accessing benefits from those systems. Authors expose the unequal distribution of health benefits among British Muslims and explore how this has come to the fore during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using reflexive, interpretive, critical and evidence-based data-driven scenarios from across the UK; this book identifies loopholes in the healthcare system affecting high-risk groups. In doing so, it analyses why and how British Muslims live with the worst health outcomes when compared with all deprived social groups and ethnicities in the country.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

We particularly welcome contributions that describe real-world problems, interdisciplinary research, experimental and/or theoretical studies, while offering new ideas in the areas of Geography and Environmental Sciences. Submitted papers should be original and related to any of the areas listed below. All accepted papers will be presented at the conference by one of the authors and published in the proceedings of MAASI with an ISBN. The acceptance will be based on quality, relevance, and originality. Presentation options include both oral and poster sessions. We have planned special sessions for case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical or scientific matters. Companies that would like to present their products or methodologies, and researchers who are interested in demonstrating a demo or presenting a tutorial are encouraged to contact the conference secretariat.

This is today's definitive single-source text and reference for managing any nonprofit organization. Designed for both professional and graduate student readers, this work thoroughly addresses all key aspects of building managerial skill and promoting imagination and innovation in organizations across the nonprofit spectrum. Herrington J. Bryce presents every technique and concept in the context of today's public policies, leading practices, laws, norms, and expectations. Herrington J. Bryce was a senior economist at the Urban Institute, a Brookings Economic Policy Fellow, a Fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard and a visiting professor in regional economics and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He taught micro economic theory and public finance at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, and was director of the program in legal and budget studies at the University College at the University of Maryland. He currently teaches courses at the College of William & Mary in nonprofits but mostly in corporate financial strategy and cost management—heavily reflected in this text. He has published extensively and has served on many state, local and federal government advisory committees. He has a PhD in economics from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, and a CLU and ChFC from the American College.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

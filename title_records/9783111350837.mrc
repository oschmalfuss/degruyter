Stephan Guth's holistic vision interprets emerging subjectivity as the key operator at the heart of the many aspects of the so-called Arab(ic) "Renaissance" (and corresponding movements in Turkish), like rationalism, critical analysis, political emancipation, reformism, moralism, and emotionalism, but also a new language, new genres, and new concepts. Guth's thoroughly philological approach demonstrates how a close reading of literary texts from the period, a cultural-psychological interpretation of linguistic phenomena and an etymology-informed look into conceptual terminology can contribute to a deeper understanding of what "modernisation" actually meant, deep inside the human beings' mind and psyche, in their meeting with a rapidly changing world. Twenty essays on language, literature, and key concepts reflect the author's life-long engagement with the culture of the period in question. The articles are glued together by a guiding narrative that assigns each treated aspect its place in the author's vision (which includes a global perspective).  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

With his wife as business partner, he orchestrated a firm that created some of the 20th century's most iconic designs, including the luxury 20th Century Limited train; the interior for Eisenhower's Air Force One; the Princess telephone; and John Deere's Gator utility vehicle— designs that defined an entire era's aesthetic.This volume examines the complete history of the Dreyfuss firm. Coauthor Russell A. Flinchum worked at the firm, recorded staff and family interviews, and took possession of hundreds of documents that were being discarded. Firsthand information from the firm's two surviving partners is documented only here. The book also includes an appendix featuring five rare works that Dreyfuss had privately printed to show the scope of his firm's work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

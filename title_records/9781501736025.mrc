The book opens with Lafayette's return to France after Yorktown to press the benefits of that victory. Displaying his role as Franklin 's "political aide-de-camp" in the diplomatic negotiations that culminated in the treaty of peace, the documents also give evidence of his personal mediation with members of the French government as well as with the King.The documents chronicling his tour of America in 1784 clearly show that Lafayette intended it to be more than a triumphal display. They reveal his desire to promote in the individual states as well as among the American people at large a sense of unity that would produce a stronger government and thus ensure the survival of those liberties for which Lafayette had been struggling. The volume ends with clear evidence that his interest did not wane with the close of the war but found renewed vigor in his determination to secure and extend those "rights of mankind" that he espoused.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

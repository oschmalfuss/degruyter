Advances in technology and medicine are helping us to live longer - but not without extended care from our families. At the same time, the economic climate is making it difficult for young adults to leave home and start their own lives; they are often 'boomeranged' back to their parents for financial help, emotional support, and accommodation. In The Family Squeeze, Suzanne Kingsmill and Ben Schlesinger trace the day-to-day life of a typical family caught up in this situation. They guide the reader through various scenarios, paying particular attention to the 'woman in the middle,' who has traditionally been the caregiver to young and old but is now also a full-time member of the workforce. Each scenario is followed by comments, advice, and suggestions that will help the reader understand each stage of the game. The resource section includes an extensive annotated bibliography, as well as a list of selected services in Canada and the United States. Internet resources are also listed.Any person who is, or about to become, a member of the Sandwich Generation will find this a helpful guide for coping with the conflicting demands of family and work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

In addition to a wide-ranging review of traditional approaches to nationalism, this book is unique in its broad geographic and historical scope and in the appraisal of these approaches in contemporary international politics, including developments such as the increased role of non-state actors, regional integration, trans-national movements and diasporas.A key element of the book is its case studies which range from the rise of national movements within the old Empires to contemporary ethnic conflicts, and which allow for a clearer understanding of the politics of nationalism, how its theories can be applied and which urge some searching questions about 'new' forms of ethno-national mobilization.Key FeaturesOnly book to cover both historical and contemporary theories of nationalismReviews classical theories of nationalismShows nationalism to be integral to all political changes and demonstrates its relevance to democracy and globalisationUses examples and case studies to demonstrate application of theories of nationalism in world politicsLinks classical and 'new' nationalism - continuities and discontinuities between the 'old' and current understandings of nationalism are highlighted"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

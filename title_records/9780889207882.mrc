The purpose is to determine what view of the Canadian Indian writers were extending in the popular national magazines, and to suggest attitudes and changes in attitudes during these seven decades. It is hoped that this endeavor will not only suggest the shape and form of concepts of the Indians as they were portrayed for the Canadian reader but that the detailed content description of each essay, as well as the bibliography compiled will be of assistance to later researchers in choosing their material and in encouraging future studies on Canadian Indians.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Pearson lived a life which took him from a childhood in rural Ontario to the apex of international politics. This third and final volume of his memoirs follows him from his years of triumph as a Canadian diplomat to his retirement from politics and the passing of the Liberal torch to Pierre Elliott Trudeau.Completed after Pearson’s death under the supervision of his son Geoffrey, this volume of Mike covers Pearson’s election as leader of the Liberal Party, his years in opposition to the Diefenbaker government, and his achievements as prime minister: a list that included the establishment of the Canada Pension Plan, universal medicare, the Auto Pact, and a new Canadian flag.Mike captures Pearson’s intellect, his sense of humour, and his humanity, offering an inside look at the decisions that shaped Canada in the twentieth century. This new edition features a foreword by Pearson cabinet minister and former prime minister Jean Chrétien.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

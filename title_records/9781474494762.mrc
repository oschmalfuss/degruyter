This volume showcases the first collection of scholarly essays addressing her diverse literary work, including nine critical essays by scholars from the UK and the USA dealing with aspects such as spirituality, socialism, eugenics, war, the short story, science, feminism, mothering, and decolonisation. The volume also features ‘Europe’: a previously unknown story by Mitchison, here published for the first time. Aimed at students, scholars, and teachers of literature from undergraduate level upwards, it is an essential resource for anyone with an interest in Mitchison’s life and literary legacy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

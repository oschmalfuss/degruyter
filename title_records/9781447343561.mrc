The key principles of collaborative, relational, child-centred working underpin all the ideas in this bestselling, practice-focused textbook. Using an innovative ‘Knowing, Being, Doing’ model, it features reflective exercises, practice examples, vignettes, cutting-edge research findings and theoretical perspectives. This new edition includes: • Updated references to policy, legislation, professional requirements, practice tools and research, including around unaccompanied young refugees and asylum seekers, and child sexual exploitation; • New learning from ethnographic and observational research of social workers’ direct practice with children; • Added focus on the context for practice, including the role of supervision and organisational containment in developing practitioners’ emotional capabilities. With detailed coverage of key skills, this book will equip students and practitioners with the critical thinking and tools needed for effective practice in order to promote the welfare, protection and rights of children and young people.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

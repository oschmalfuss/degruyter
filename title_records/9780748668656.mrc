What is its cultural function now, in an era of commemoration? Focusing particularly on the British context, this study offers the first analysis of contemporary popular and literary fiction, film, TV and art exhibitions about Nazis and Nazism. Petra Rau brings this material into dialogue with earlier responses to fascism and demonstrates how, paradoxically, Nazism has been both mediated and mythologised to the extent that it now often replaces a critical engagement with actual, violent history.In 5 thematic chapters on Nazi Noir, Men in Uniform, Vile Bodies, The Good German and Meta-Cinematic Farce, Rau provides close analysis of contemporary novels such as Jason Lutes’ graphic novel series Berlin, historical crime fiction by Philip Kerr and others, Robert Harris’ Fatherland, Ian McEwan’s Black Dogs and Justin Cartwright’s The Song Before It Is Sung; films such as Bryan Singer’s Valkyrie and Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Bastards; art installations including Mirroring Evil: Nazi Imagery/Recent Art, and Fucking Hell by Jake and Dinos Chapman; and Piotr Uklanski’s photo frieze, Untitled (The Nazis).Key Features:Broad interdisciplinary approach which includes literature, film, TV and artWide coverage of popular forms and High ArtComparison with earlier material about fascism which reaches back to the 1930s  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

The subject dictates their day-to-day and strategic activities, especially corporate information asset risk management and investment, and the ICT infrastructure within which those information assets are collected, manipulated, stored and deployed. But what is corporate governance, and why is it important to the IT professional? Why is IT governance important to the company director, and what do directors of companies - both "ed and un"ed - need to know? The Calder-Moir Framework The book also explains how to integrate each standard and framework using The Calder-Moir Framework (download for free from www.itgovernance.co.uk/calder_moir.aspx), which was developed specifically to help organisations manage and govern their IT operations more effectively, and to coordinate the sometimes wide range of overlapping and competing frameworks and standards. It also specifically supports implementation of ISO/IEC 38500, the international standard for best practice IT governance. Practical IT Governance guidance Board executives and IT professionals can learn to maximise their use of the numerous IT management and IT governance frameworks and standards - particularly ISO/IEC 38500 - to best corporate and commercial advantage. Build an IT Governance Framework Within a 'super framework', or 'meta -framework', you can integrate each of these standards and frameworks whilst making sure that each can deliver what it was designed to do. Developing an overarching framework will enable your organisation to design IT governance to meet your own needs.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

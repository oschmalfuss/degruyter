In Negotiating Identities, Diane Gérin-Lajoie uses a critical sociological framework to explore the life stories of Anglophone teachers and illustrate the social practices which connect them with their linguistic, cultural, and professional identities. Exploring the complexity of identity as a lived experience, Negotiating Identities demonstrates the strength of language as a political force in these educators’ lives both in the classroom and outside it. Through comparisons with the other official linguistic minority in Canada, the Francophones, and particularly with Franco-Ontarians, this book tells the stories of Quebec’s Anglophone teachers in their own words, providing a unique account of how these individuals make sense of their lives as residents of Quebec.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

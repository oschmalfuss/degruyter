Wilfrid was a saint for all seasons: histhree feast days punctuated the cycle of the agricultural year and an annual procession sought his blessings on the growing crops each May. This procession brought together many of the parish's earthly lords - the clergy and the gentry - as they carried the relics of their celestial patron. In death they hoped that they too would be remembered, and so remain a part of parish society for as long as their tombs survived or prayers were said for them in the church of Ripon. This book charts the developments in the practice of religion, and in particular the commemoration of the deceased, from the late fourteenth to the early sixteenth centuries in this important parish. In particular, it shows how the twin necessities of honouring the minster's patron saint and remembering the parish dead had a profound effect on the practice of religion in late medieval Ripon, shaping everything from the ritual calendarto weekly and daily religious routines. It provides, moreover, insights into the state of English religion on the eve of the Reformation. Stephen Werronen completed his PhD at the University of Leeds and is currently a visiting researcher at the Arnamagnæan Institute, University of Copenhagen.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

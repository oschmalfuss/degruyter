The book presents a new perspective on the effect of violence on individual personalities as well as on the ability of veterans to reintegrate into society by addressing the damage done to language as an injury. It highlights that soldiers work through an incompatibility between a former way of life and their new linguistic reality by forming a different mode of speaking, through literature or poetry. The independent nature of these poems sheds light on the process of returning to life through writing, and on the life-giving force of literature for repatriated veterans.

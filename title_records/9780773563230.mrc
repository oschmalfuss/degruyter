As a result, there is a growing basic consensus among the French people. At the same time, the French have developed a new interest in managing local problems -- due to the decentralization law -- which has led to the establishment of many voluntary associations. Changes in family life following the "revolution" of 1968 have led to greater instability among couples, but at the same time have strengthened the kinship system resulting in increased life expectancy. The customs of the French have also changed. The French education system, originally based on authority and regulations, is now making increasing use of experimentation and negotiation. As a result, the attitude of the French towards authority has totally changed and the French have learned to negotiate and cooperate among themselves. All these changes can be interpreted as progressive moves toward liberty, equality, and individualism. There is little danger of social instability, since French society remains in remarkably robust health.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

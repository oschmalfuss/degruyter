The risks are too high and the costs too great.In Making Money Moral: How a New Wave of Visionaries Is Linking Purpose and Profit, authors Judith Rodin and Saadia Madsbjerg explore a burgeoning movement of bold and ambitious innovators. These trailblazers are unlocking private-sector investments in new ways to solve global problems, from environmental challenges to social issues such as poverty and inequality. They are earning great returns and reimagining capitalism in the process.Pioneers in the field of sustainable and impact investing, Rodin and Madsbjerg offer first-hand stories of how investors of every type and in every asset class are investing in world-changing solutions—with great success. Meet the visionaries who are leading this movement:The investment managers putting trillions of dollars to work, like TPG, Wellington Management, State Street Global Advisors, Nuveen, Amundi, APG and Natixis;The asset owners driving the transition, like GPIF and PensionDanmark;A new generation of entrepreneurs benefiting from the investments, like DreamBox Learning, an innovative educational technology platform, and Goodlife Pharmacies, which is disrupting the traditional notion of a pharmacy; The corporations that are repurposing their business models to meet demand for sustainable products and services, like Ørsted; andThe nonprofits that are reimagining how to raise money for their work while creating significant value for investors, like The Nature Conservancy.In their book, Rodin and Madsbjerg offer a deep look at the most powerful tools available today—and how they can be unlocked. They reveal:Who the investors are and what they want;How innovative products and investment strategies can deliver long-term value for investors while improving lives and protecting ecosystems;How leaders can build strategies and prepare their organizations to enter and expand this dynamic market; andHow to measure impact, understand critical regulations, and avoid potential pitfalls.A roadmap to making the financial market a force for good, Making Money Moral is a must-read for those seeking private-sector capital to address a big problem, as well as those seeking both to mitigate risk and to invest in big solutions."Judith Rodin and Saadia Madsbjerg identify an important new way of looking at money: from the root of all evil to the fount of all solutions. Their timely, important book on impact investing is full of powerful insights and compelling examples they've seen firsthand. Their work will be sure to accelerate momentum toward a more sustainable world."—Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School Professor and Author of Think Outside the Building: How Advanced Leaders Can Change the World One Smart Innovation at a Time  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

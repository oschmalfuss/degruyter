In this long overdue exploration of Wilber's life and work, Frank Visser not only outlines the theories of this profound thinker, but also uncovers his personal life, showing how his experiences influenced and shaped his writing.Wilber's impressive body of work, including nineteen books in more than thirty languages, brings together science and religion, philosophy, art, culture, East and West, and places them within the all-encompassing perspective of evolution. Visser's book follows Wilber's four distinct phases as he reveals not only the story behind Wilber's writing, but also the man behind the ideas. In recounting the course of Wilber's life and the motives that led him to the subjects he has written so much about, Visser uncovers the intricacies of one of the world's most important intellectuals. Included in this indispensable resource is a complete bibliography of Wilber's work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

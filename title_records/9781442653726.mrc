Patients with such disorders may be encountered in general practice, emergency wards, medical services, on the surgical ward, post-operatively as well as in psychiatric clinics and of course in mental hospitals. A specialist in psychiatry and a specialist in internal medicine have collaborated to fill an important gap in medical literature of practical value to the physician. Throughout the book the needs of doctors who are responsible for such patients has been kept in mind. In this well-organized, concise monograph the organic psychoses are classified in a comprehensive manner which can be easily applied to clinical cases. The chief diagnostic features of the various organic syndromes have been presented, together with full references to the clinical literature. The diagnostic approach to the various clinical problems has been considered and illustrated by a group of case histories. As teachers, the authors have become aware of the need for a clarification of this complicated area of medicine in order that the practitioner, postgraduate physician, interne, and undergraduate student may have a ready guide to aid him in the diagnosis of these complicated disorders. Many doctors in a number of branches of medical practice will find this a handy, useful book to own.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

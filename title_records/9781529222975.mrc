It offers guidance on understanding how this type of discrimination is prohibited and proposes how laws can be reformed to better address classism and related problems in modern workplaces. The increased uptake of artificial intelligence, algorithms and social media as recruitment tools and the post-pandemic shift to remote working is examined. The book demonstrates how these practices create new inequalities and significant opportunities for discrimination based on class and social background, and re-imagines them to mitigate the problems that arise from their use.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

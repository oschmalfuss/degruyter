The volume of the text and its annotations did not allow including the detailed scholarly introduction into the same volume as is the custom with the other CEMT items. The essays in the book analyze the text and the illuminations of the Illuminated Chronicle in literaryhistorical, art historical and heraldic context. The relevant literature that goes back to more than 200 years is also summarized. Additional studies address issues connected with the narrative. Since the chronicle starts with the history of the Huns, imaginary ancestors of the Hungarians, the Attila tradition in Hungarian history writing is discussed. Extensive coverage is offered on the dynastic struggles of the eleventh century, placing them into the context of amicitia and deditio. The image of King St. Ladislas I as the "ideal king" is reviewed, a topic that received conspicuously detailed coverage in the chronicle. Finally, the fate of the fourteenthcentury chronicle texts during the subsequent centuries is examined, their appearance in legal texts, and their reception abroad.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

Thoroughly updated to include developments from the mid-2000s onwards, this second edition includes new case studies, a new chapter on American Independent Cinema in the Age of Media Convergence, a new prologue and an enhanced epilogue and bibliography. Each chapter includes case studies focusing on specific films or filmmakers, and independent production and distribution companies are discussed throughout the text.Films, filmmakers and film companies examined include:Cagney Productions and Johnny Come Lately, Blood on the Sun and The Time of Your LifeJohn Ford and StagecoachThe Charlie Chan seriesLomitas Productions, Stanley Kramer and The Defiant Ones, On the Beach and Inherit the WindWilliam Castle and MacabreJohn Cassavetes and ShadowsDennis Hopper and The Last MovieAmerican International Pictures and Foxy BrownJohn Sayles and Return of the Secaucus SevenFilmhaus Productions, David Mamet and House of GamesSteven Soderbergh and Sex, Lies and VideotapeKevin Smith and ClerksMichael London Productions and SidewaysDuplass Brothers, Through Films and TangerineMonogram, Republic Pictures and Producers Releasing CorporationWilliam Castle Productions, Embassy Pictures, New World Pictures, Dimension and Crown InternationalOrion PicturesThe Sundance Film Institute  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

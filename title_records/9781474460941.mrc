It refers to a living dimension that has overthrown the structures of power in which humans are supposedly destined to live, disclosing the possibility of a new understanding of political and legal life. By placing ‘form-of-life’ in the context of contemporary philosophy, this book re-imagines anew some of the basic categories of human socialities – such as work, rights, obligation, property, and use. It explores the ways in which Agamben’s philosophy might be a strategic resource for developing political and legal strategies that leave behind a situation dominated by pervasive sovereign violence.At a moment of history in which the fundamental promises of Western modernity are undergoing a decisive crisis, to look beyond the basic categories of human social institutions becomes an urgency. Through a close engagement with Agamben’s concept of form-of-life, this book seeks to challenge the current crisis of juridical, political and economic reality.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 03.

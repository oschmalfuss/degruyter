This updated second edition of Linear Systems Theory covers the subject's key topics in a unique lecture-style format, making the book easy to use for instructors and students. João Hespanha looks at system representation, stability, controllability and state feedback, observability and state estimation, and realization theory. He provides the background for advanced modern control design techniques and feedback linearization and examines advanced foundational topics, such as multivariable poles and zeros and LQG/LQR. The textbook presents only the most essential mathematical derivations and places comments, discussion, and terminology in sidebars so that readers can follow the core material easily and without distraction. Annotated proofs with sidebars explain the techniques of proof construction, including contradiction, contraposition, cycles of implications to prove equivalence, and the difference between necessity and sufficiency. Annotated theoretical developments also use sidebars to discuss relevant commands available in MATLAB, allowing students to understand these tools. This second edition contains a large number of new practice exercises with solutions. Based on typical problems, these exercises guide students to succinct and precise answers, helping to clarify issues and consolidate knowledge. The book's balanced chapters can each be covered in approximately two hours of lecture time, simplifying course planning and student review. Easy-to-use textbook in unique lecture-style formatSidebars explain topics in further detailAnnotated proofs and discussions of MATLAB commandsBalanced chapters can each be taught in two hours of course lectureNew practice exercises with solutions included  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

It is a detailed statistical description and analysis of the transition from high to low birth rates which took place in Germany between Unification and the beginning of World War II. It assembles an exceptionally comprehensive amount of evidence that will be of great importance to social historians as well as sociologists and demographers. John E. Knodel relies on modern yet simple methods of measuring the main demographic trends in Germany and uses straightforward methods to test the plausibility of the many hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the great falls in fertility that occurred throughout the western world in the late nineteenth century.Originally published in 1974.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

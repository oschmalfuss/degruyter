Among its nearly 4,000 entries are included the books, pamphlets, theses, dissertations, and articles in journals and magazines which supply the context and commentary on the history of Canadian higher education. Part I of the Bibliography provides the context; our universities do not exist in a vacuum—they are part of the economic, political, religious and social life of the community. Part I, therefore, includes a section on Canadian Culture, listing histories of Canada and its provinces, of its religious and social institutions, of its art, its economy, racial groups, relations with other countries. In order to study higher education in relation to other levels of education, another section lists works concerned with educational developments and problems at all levels. Part II lists the works bearing directly on higher education in Canada, and includes sections on History and Organization, Curriculum and Teaching, The Professor, The Student. Entries are arranged in chronological order in all sections in order to present the progressive development of each topic, and a full Index enables easy reference by author. No distinction has been drawn between English- and French-language publications: Chemistry and Chimie are one subject. The relative proportion of English and French entries in a section is often significant as indicating differences in the frequency and importance of particular fields of study in our colleges.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Changes in cultural values concerning gender, ideals about family relationships, and ideas of the appropriate role women brought uncertainty, confusion, and contradiction. Anne Powell's life embodied this shift in values and provides an example of how they were carried from the old world to the new. A Life of Propriety makes an innovative contribution to the literature on women in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and will also be of interest to scholars in women's studies, and early Ontario and Canadian history, as well as to the general reader. "Sets the story of the Powell family in the context of a growing international literature on gender and family relations in an important period of change . a captivating story and a great read." Alison Prentice, Department of History and Philosophy, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Although ITIL’s popularity as a framework for IT service management (ITSM) continues to increase, a number of organisations have realised that its approach is sometimes not quite enough on its own. Many are already working towards compliance with ISO 20000-1 — the international standard for ITSM — but, with the likes of COBIT 5 and CMMI-SVC to consider as well, it can be difficult to determine the best route to take. Until now, there has been little guidance on how to merge these frameworks in order to produce a robust enterprise philosophy for service delivery. Pragmatic Application of Service Management – The Five Anchor Approach provides that guidance. Product overview Completely updated by service management gurus Suzanne D. Van Hove and Mark Thomas, the second edition of Pragmatic Application of Service Management – The Five Anchor Approach provides comprehensive guidance on creating an integrated system based on COBIT 5, ISO 20000, ITIL and CMMI-SVC. This practical book enables service managers to immediately adapt and deploy the guidance, and quickly improve their ITSM function. It now features a short chapter on applying the ‘five anchors’ approach to integrating service management frameworks in very small enterprises (VSEs), and contains four new ‘caselets’ (short case studies). Packed with instructive illustrations, helpful tables and the authors’ very own five anchor approach, this book is ideal for anyone considering adopting, adapting or merging COBIT5, ISO/IEC 20000, ITIL and CMMI-SVC. Better ITSM through integrated best practice Written by service management gurus Suzanne D. Van Hove and Mark Thomas, Pragmatic Application of Service Management – The Five Anchors Approach presents a holistic view of service management, and provides a unique mapping to assist service management practitioners in their information gathering.

There, he nevertheless continued his work to point out the impact of war, genocide and displacement on children, who were often forgotten in major discussions about the war and the losses it had created. This volume provides a short biographical outline of Papanek and a theoretical discussion about the impact of war and genocide on children who are forced out of their lives and who were not only physically displaced as a consequence. The second part of the book assembles some of Papanek's important texts about the children he had worked with and for, to make his thoughts and important considerations accessible for a broader academic and non-academic public alike.  aIssued also in print.  afunded by Nord University  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

Using this rich seam of material, Gerri Kimber explores Mansfield’s home life and school days, her friendships, first infatuations and sexual experimentation both with young men and young women and her travels through the volcanic North Island of New Zealand and examines her earliest published stories which appeared in school magazines. What emerges is a picture of a feisty, mischievous, young girl and an expressive, non-conformist teenager: the unruly Kass Beauchamp who became Katherine Mansfield, the famous modernist writer.Key Features Brings to light a period of Mansfield’s life previously of little interest to biographersPresents a new image of Mansfield as a child and young womanReveals how her youthful experiences fashioned both her later personality and the content of much of her acclaimed adult writingDiscussion of the biographical elements present in Mansfield’s New Zealand stories  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

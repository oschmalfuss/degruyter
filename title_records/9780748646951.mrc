But what is happening behind the sensational headlines? Jørgen Nielsen looks at the processes and realities, from voting patterns in local and national assemblies to the tensions between ethnic, political and religious identities. These developments drive internal Muslim debates including whether Muslims should take part in the democratic process at all, and rivalries over who should represent Muslims. They also inspire sharp discussion in Europe: how should European states view the increasingly active role of Muslims in the public space? Does it signal integration or separation?Key Features16 chapters based on up-to-date research on European Muslim political participationAnalyses and compares local and national situations in Belgium, Catalonia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the UKFocuses on issues such as Muslim women and youth  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

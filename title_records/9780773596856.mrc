Bush sought to reassure the American public that Osama bin Laden would be brought to justice, quipping that "there's an old poster out West, as I recall, that said, 'Wanted: Dead or Alive.'" Bush's invocation of Wild West mythology was neither novel nor unusual - elected officials frequently tap into popular culture in order to mobilize public support for themselves and for their policies. The Politics of Popular Culture examines the relationship between popular culture and politics. It stresses that popular culture is politically important because it reflects and operates within broader socio-political conditions, can transport political ideas and ideologies, and is a site where identities and institutions are shaped, contested, and reproduced. Essays discuss film, television, music, and video games from a variety of theoretical and methodological vantage points in order to enrich our understanding of the ways in which popular culture shapes our views of political institutions, actors, and issues.

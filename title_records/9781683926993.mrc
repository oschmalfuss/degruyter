Make Amazing Games, third edition, introduces the game creation process to the aspiring game developer with no experience or programming ability. Taking the reader step-by-step through the various stages of developing a game and using the popular "drag and drop" game creation software (a free feature limited version which is available from Steam), readers can build their very own games. Using the tutorials, the reader will complete four fully playable games including platform, bat & ball, mouse-clicker, and side-scrolling shoot-’em up, games. Other chapters cover more complex game features such as porting the game onto the Web, distribution, and publishing. This must-have book is the essential resource for anyone interested in learning game creation from beginning to end. Includes companion files with 4-color figures, game demos, graphic libraries, and source code. FEATURES:Includes a discussion of the different types of games, necessary game resources, importing graphics, and some basic programming conceptsFeatures detailed information on downloading, installing, and using the free Fusion softwareCreate four games from scratch with Fusion: a platform game, side-scroller shooter, a bat-and-ball game, and a mouse-clicker gameCovers backing up your game, debugging, marketing, distribution, and moreIncludes companion files with 4-color figures, game demos, graphic libraries, and source code.The companion files are available online by emailing the publisher with proof of purchase at info@merclearning.com.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

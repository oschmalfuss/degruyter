It examines notable tournaments and pageantry held at the courts of Charles V and Philip II, and the artworks associated with them. Braden Frieder guides the reader through these tournaments, jousting, and other knightly exercises as part of a larger aristocratic culture that included arms and armor, paintings, tapestries, medals, and sculptures with chivalric themes. Frieder presents Habsburg tournaments in their proper historical context as an extension of imperial politics, drawing comparisons with popular chivalric literature of the period. Frieder's study utilizes extensive primary source material and contemporary documents, many appearing for the first time in English.Included in this book are eighty-one illustrations of fine art and armor from the sixteenth century, the crescendo of the armorer&apos;s art in Europe. For the first time in print, these artworks are treated collectively, as integral parts of aristocratic life and culture during the Renaissance.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

In an increasingly volatile world – exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic – organisations are looking at business continuity from a fresh perspective. The illusion of business as a rampart against which the waves of the world break harmlessly is shattered; it is no longer possible to pretend that an organisation can weather all storms equally, or that the limited contingencies organisations develop are sufficient to protect them. As a result, more and more organisations are looking to ISO 22301 – the international standard that defines the requirements for a BCMS – to safeguard their future. ISO 22301 requirements and business continuity best practice ISO 22301:2019 and business continuity management – Understand how to plan, implement and enhance a business continuity management system (BCMS) walks you through the requirements of ISO 22301:2019, explaining what they mean and how your organisation can achieve compliance.

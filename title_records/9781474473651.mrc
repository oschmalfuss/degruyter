Hillis Miller, the single most significant North American literary critic of the twentieth century. First published in the 1950s, Miller has continued to make invaluable contributions to our understanding of the practice and theory of literary criticism, the ethics and responsibilities of teaching and reading, and the role of literature in the modern world. He has also led the way for successive generations of scholars and students in demonstrating the necessity of comprehending the relationship between philosophy and literature.Divided into five sections - The Ethics of Reading, Victorian Interests, Twentieth-Century Occasions, Practice and Theory, Pedagogical and Political Commitments - the Reader provides more than twenty extracts from some of Miller's most significant publications including one unpublished article. In addition, there is also a new interview with J. Hillis Miller, as well as a series of specially commissioned critical responses to Miller's work by some of the most important critics in literary and cultural studies today. A critical introduction by the editor, a comprehensive bibliography and a chronology of Miller's professional life and activities complete the book.This, the first reader of Miller's work in English, is an indispensable overview and introduction to one of the most original and challenging critical voices to have emerged since the inception of the teaching of English and American literature in universities in the English-speaking world.FeaturesPresents a comprehensive survey of J Hillis Miller's work introducing the reader to a highly original critical voice known especially for his work on the ethics of reading, deconstruction, Victorian and Twentieth-Century literature, pedagogy and politicsThe readings range from the 1950s to the present day, reflecting all major aspects of cutting edge literary critici  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

This is the summary of a career and a field (plant biology), written in accessible language so that it can extend its reach beyond a small circle of specialists. The book is probably the most up-to-date account of movement in plants. It draws on examples across the spectrum of plant families, including mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants. The book begins with an explanation of how cellular motors work and then describes how cells manage to move organs. The bulk of the book explains how plants and plant organs (roots, stems, leaves, flowers) move in different environments and situations. Movement of roots, tubers, rhizomes and other plant parts underground is described in detail and much of this information is suprising because we normally don’t see it happening. Movement of stems and leaves toward the light is the research specialty of the author, and is explained in detail in two chapters. Effort is made to present information at the subcellular and cellular levels, including the roles of receptors, signaling pathways, hormones, and physiological responses leading to motor function. The adaptive significance of movements is discussed in each case.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

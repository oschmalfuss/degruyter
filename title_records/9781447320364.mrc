This book takes a critical approach to the transformation agenda and the implications for adult health and social care. Fully informed by theory, research, policy and legislation the book uses a problem-based learning approach through the application of case studies to explain and explore the overlapping roles of social care and social policy. The book argues for the continued significance and importance of social work within the context of adult social care. It shows that social work can make a difference in the lives and experiences of many of the people who are perceived as being the most vulnerable people in society. This text is essential reading for students of social work and social policy, health and social care courses and other professional disciplines, social work educators and practitioners, and managers working in social care.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

Through a wide range of perspectives, Partnership working aims to integrate theory and practice across a number of policy areas. Using a variety of models, it: highlights both positive and negative aspects of partnership working at political, cultural and technical levels; shows how partnerships can empower people and groups through effective collaboration; suggests some of the principles on which good practice should be based and the resources required; addresses key issues of accountability, representation and social exclusion. The book provides important reading for academics, policy makers, service providers and senior practitioners in community development and community safety, local government, housing, social services and health. It will also be a valuable resource for those working in voluntary organisations and students on professional courses.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

Although some aestheticians, beginning with Longinus, discussed these features during the past two millennia, they did not analyze them comprehensively, nor did they justify them from the standpoint of a satisfactory conception of the nature of art. In this book, the author first explains the nature of the features that make an artifact art and then proceeds to establish the validity of his thesis on firm epistemological and ontological foundations. In his endeavor to explicate the nature of this foundation, the author answers four questions. First, what is the genesis of the artwork? What makes it art? He answers this question by advancing a concept of aesthetic depth. The essence of this depth is human meaning. Second, under what perceptual conditions does this depth come to life in the process of aesthetic perception? Third, what is the role of the concept of aesthetic depth in the analysis of the nature of the great artwork? How does the concept of aesthetic depth function as a principle of explanation? Fourth, how can we justify the attribution of magic, universality, and the test of time to the great work of art? In short, an understanding of the genesis of the artwork, aesthetic depth, aesthetic value, and aesthetic perception is indispensable for an adequate conception of greatness in art.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

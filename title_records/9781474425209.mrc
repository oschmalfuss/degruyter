It was with the overwhelming success of Marmion that Scott’s poetic reputation was indisputably established, his immersion in the world of commercial publishing confirmed, and his commitment to a literary life fully determined. Scott here features as a topical poet, commemorating both national events and occasions, as well as the work of his contemporaries. His relations with aristocratic patrons, artists, and statesmen are also amply reflected in the dedicatory epistles. This is arguably the most challenging and most rewarding of all Scott poems. The critical apparatus in this volume includes an extended essay on the development of the text, a Historical Note, Explanatory Notes and a full glossary of Scots, foreign and archaic words.Key FeaturesIncludes lines omitted from previous editions of the poemBased on new archival research it provides critically edited text and extensive annotations  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

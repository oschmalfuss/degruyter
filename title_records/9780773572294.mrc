By enlisting the aid not only of doctors and nurses but teachers, lawyers, social workers, psychologists, politicians, family, friends, and neighbours, the physical, social, emotional, and spiritual needs of children can be met, assuring every child of a loving and stimulating environment, quality education, and the opportunity for growth and development. The first part of "A Different Kind of Care" describes the principles and concepts of the social pediatrics approach. The second part tells the stories of children living in appalling conditions who suffer from various forms of trauma and rejection. The book also includes a number of case studies that demonstrate the need for and effectiveness of the theory. Julien shows that such children, if given a chance, can not only become healthy but find new meaning in life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

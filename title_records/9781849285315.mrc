Information and information systems are vital to every organisation. Our reliance on data and information, and the fact that it is so easy to share, means that everyone is at risk of cyber attack from hackers, viruses, online fraudsters, malicious insiders, or even from simple human error. Manage cyber threat To counter these threats you have to identify the real information risks your business faces, then you need to find the most appropriate way to mitigate such risks. Adopting the ISO27001 Standard will give your organisation a reliable framework for creating an information security management system. The business case for investing in information security This friendly guide, updated to reflect ISO27001:2013, presents the compelling business case for implementing ISO27001 in order to protect your information assets. This makes it ideal reading for anyone unfamiliar with the many benefits of the standard, and as a supporting document for an ISO27001 project proposal.   Understand ISO27001 and learn how your organisation can: Fight cybercrime - Introducing the ISO 27001 information security management system will help protect your business from the threat of organised crime. Combat cyber-terror - Terrorist organisations now work with computers as well as explosives. Introducing an information security management system makes it easier to defend your company from a destructive cyber-attack. Improve your corporate governance - Reducing your company’s financial exposure to the risk of losses resulting from IT system failure is now a corporate governance requirement. ISO 27001 will help you to comply. Recover from accidents - With ISO 27001, you can minimise the risk that your information will be lost or corrupted as a result of human error. Read this book to learn how ISO27001 secures your information assets and protects your business.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

Rastell also promoted and published important humanist texts, including two dialogues by Thomas More, a number of plays, including Interlude of the Four Elements which he may have written himself, and several works by John Skelton. Like other Renaissance humanist printers Rastell borrowed woodcuts, shared out the work of printing long multi-volume works, and even shared type on occasion. But his life as a publisher was turbulent, as demonstrated by several changes of address for his printing establishment in London and numerous changes in his printers and typesetters. Devereux's work is a significant addition to Renaissance bibliography, providing important new information for those who study early modern humanism, especially the historiography of law and religion in England.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

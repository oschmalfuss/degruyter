But getting a university education can also be a source of undue stress. What courses should I take? What program should I get in to? Will I get a job after graduation? It's easy to become discouraged, especially when you don't see what relationship studying Plato, Shakespeare, or Sartre has to the real world. How to Succeed at University (and Get a Great Job!) shows that the best preparation for success at life and on the job is succeeding at university. Giving oral presentations, working in teams, meeting deadlines, overcoming challenges, locating information, explaining events, writing well, and dealing with people in authority are essential in any professional job. These same skills are also vital for becoming a strong student. This book gives you advice and strategies, along with real-life examples, on how to improve the skills that guarantee success at school, work, and in life. More than that, by mastering these easy-to-learn skills, you will also have the time to enjoy all the other benefits that a university education provides. This practical guide is meant for university, college, and high school students, as well as instructors, guidance counsellors, and parents. In answering many of the questions that students and recent graduates have about succeeding in their courses and in their post-school careers, this book shows that the path from university to the real world can be straightforward and exciting if you know what you are doing.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Based on the premise that deconstruction and demystification are a necessary counterforce to 'shared myths,' François Tochon offers a provocative, original assessment of mass educational concepts and teacher education, leading to a challenge of rethinking pedagogy in general. The author identifies three shaping metaphors: 'productivity' (output standardization; business efficiency), 'warfare' (strategy; expertise), and 'priesthood' (the enlightened subject) ? which he argues stifle individual growth in a classroom context. He then advocates an entirely different approach, which he terms 'a countermethodology of self-reflection, rather than an incursion into the life of the Other.' This approach is achieved, in part, via a technique he calls Action-Poetry: a means of research and educational activism.Tochon's original contribution to educational scholarship ? and his direct challenge to educators themselves ? is the practice of reflective, situated research with classroom observation (his own journal entries are included in the text). Tropics of Teaching is a call to education specialists and to scholars in social and literary studies to rethink current education curricula, policies, and philosophies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 08.

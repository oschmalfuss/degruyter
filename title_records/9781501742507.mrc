It follows him on his return to France in January 1779, on leave from the American army, and ends in the spring of 1780, when he was sent back to America to announce the coming of the French expeditionary force and to help formulate American plans for cooperation with the French forces.Complementing Lafayette 's personal memoirs, which open the two parts of the book, are exchanges of letters with such prominent figures as George Washington1 Henry Laurens, Benjamin Franklin, the Comte d'Estaing, John Paul Jones, and the Comte de Vergennes. The documents and letters written in English are published as they appear in the manuscripts; those written in French appear both in the original and in translation.Much of the basic material for this series, which will comprise six volumes, is drawn from Lafayette's own collection of manuscripts. A brilliant portrait of Lafayette in his own words, the books reveal much more complex elements in his character and outlook than have been apparent before.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 25.

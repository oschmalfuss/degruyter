This study understands Jonson, first and foremost, as a comedy writer, linking his work with modern film comedies such as the Marx Brothers, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty Python. It is a new approach to Jonsonian studies, responding to the current Marxist-Lacanian studies of literature, film and culture made popular by scholars such as Slavoj Žižek, Alenka Zupančič and Mladen Dolar. While the book pays close attention to the historical context of Jonson’s time, it brings him to the twenty-first century by discussing early modern comedies with modern critical theories and film.Key FeaturesReads Ben Jonson in fresh ways from various theoretical perspectives including psychoanalysis, poststructuralism and MarxismShows readers how the dwarf, the androgyne, the eunuch and the parasite are instrumental to the understanding of Volpone and other Jonson’s comedies including Epicoene, The Alchemist and Bartholomew FairProvides readers with a new understanding of Jonson’s comedy, early modern city comedy and the difference between comedy and tragedyCompares Jonson with other early modern plays such as Shakespeare’s King Richard III and Twelfth Night, Middleton’s A Mad World, My Masters and A Chaste Maid in Cheapside and Massinger’s The RenegadoCompares Jonson’s comedies with modern film comedies such as the Marx Brothers, Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty Python  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

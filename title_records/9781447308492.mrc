Only their parents or grandparents remember the daily exposures of police incompetence and indirect racism which were given high profile in the media for six months. The repercussions of the case are still on-going with the long overdue conviction in 2012 of two of the original suspects, and in the same year a number of racist assaults by police. This unique book provides an insider's view of the seminal inquiry into Stephen Lawrence's murder. Dr Richard Stone OBE was a panel member of the Inquiry as Adviser to the judge, Sir William Macpherson. This accessible and engaging book includes analysis of hitherto inaccessible transcripts. These dramatically show how the Inquiry was undermined to the point of failure to produce the desired results. Dr Stone also discusses contemporary issues and the relevance of the Inquiry today. He says I have written about my experience because I feel a degree of obligation to tell, from my position at the centre of the Inquiry, just how difficult issues were dealt with. Hard-hitting and full of insightful detail, this book makes essential reading for academics, students, researchers and anyone interested in institutional racism, particularly in the police.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

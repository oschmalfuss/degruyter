The appearance of the first of a similar series dealing with Canadian elections is to be welcomed, particularly since this election was a critical one in the fortunes of the two major Canadian parties. The book provides an account of conditions in Canada in 1957 as a background for its discussion of election issues and party organizations. It deals with the emergence of Mr. Difenbaker as the Conservative leader just before the election and with the impact of his leadership on the Conservative party. The election strategy of the various parties, the work of their national headquarters, campaigning in the constituencies, and the activities and style of the leaders are described and assessed. The origins of the party programmes and their substance are examined and compared, as are also the characteristics of the candidates. In a final chapter and in the appendices the results of the election are presented and analysed.By dealing with his subject within a broad context, the author has produced not only a study of a critical Canadian election but also a searching analysis of our political parties at a moment when the party system was undergoing a fundamental change.Topical, readable, and authoritative, this study should prove of great interest and value to all students of Canadian politics and sociology, to practising politicians and to readers who follow trends in public affairs.

They examine the influences on Weber, as well as his similarities to and differences from Marx, Burckhardt, Nietzsche, Durkheim, and others. The authors also give attention to the ideological background of the modern attack upon the university, and to comparative study of values, authority, and legitimation. Bendix's Presidential Address to the 1970 meeting of the American Sociological Association is included.This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

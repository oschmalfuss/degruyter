The Kirk, Scots Law, Hampden Park? There are several contenders, but school is the universal and enduring one. Stories and myths have clustered around its chief features:Pupils as lads o' pairts.Teachers as dominies.The democratic intellect.The village skweel.Hard work, getting on and the power of the tawse.Academic excellence and 'sticking in'.Telling the tale of Scotland's educational experience over the past 250 years, this book draws on the first-hand testimony of pupils, teachers and parents - with extracts taken from biography, local history, journal and oral interview, along with fascinating contemporary photographs.The anthologised material is accompanied by David Northcroft's narrative outlining the history of the distinctive Scottish school system. By drawing out key themes of identity, nationalism and 'democracy', he sets the claims that have traditionally been made for the system's excellence and independent spirit against the accounts of people's actual experiences.This history, enhanced by the personal stories of those involved, offers the reader a vivid account of the experience of Scottish schooling.Key FeaturesStrong 'nostalgia' market for books of this kind.Draws on broad range of personal testimony.Includes extracts from Tom Devine, John Galt, Hugh Miller, Magnus Magnusson, Neil Munro, Alan Spence and T. C. Smout.Each section is prefaced with an editorial introduction - taken together, they trace the Scottish educational experience over the past 250 years.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The volume is divided into a number of cross-referenced sections which address the preoccupations and historical events of this crucial period in recent history and culture. Central to the book’s function as a durable reference work is an extensive A-Z glossary which clarifies Victorian terminology and explains key historical and political events. This is supplemented with a chronology listing significant domestic, imperial and international events from 1837 to 1901; a tabulation of British Prime Ministers in office during Queen Victoria’s reign; a succinct but detailed survey of the most important acts of Parliament in the period; an explanation of pre-decimal British coinage; and a useful chart which converts imperial measurement into their metric equivalents. This book is an essential reference for scholars of Victorian literature and history from undergraduate to postgraduate level.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

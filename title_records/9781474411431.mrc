Applying the metaphor of the ‘border crossing’ from one temporal or spatial territory into another, Border Crossing: Russian Literature into Film examines the way classic Russian texts have been altered to suit new cinematic environments.In these essays, international scholars examine how political and economic circumstances, from a shifting Soviet political landscape to the perceived demands of American and European markets, have played a crucial role in dictating how filmmakers transpose their cinematic hypertext into a new environment. Rather than focus on the degree of accuracy or fidelity with which these films address their originating texts, this innovative collection explores the role of ideological, political and other cultural pressures that can affect the transformation of literary narratives into cinematic offerings.ContributorsOtto Boele is an Associate Professor of Russian literature at the University of LeidenAlexander Burry is an Associate Professor of Slavic and East European Languages and Cultures at The Ohio State UniversityOlga Peters Hasty is a Professor in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Princeton UniversityDennis Ioffe is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Languages and Cultures at Ghent UniversityThomas Leitch teaches English and directs the Film Studies program at the University of DelawareYuri Leving is Professor of Russian Literature and Film in the Department of Russian Studies, Dalhousie University, CanadaRonald Meyer teaches the seminar in Russian literary translation at Columbia UniversityRobert Mulcahy is a Lecturer in Slavic at The Ohio State UniversityS.

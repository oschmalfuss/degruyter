The presence of enslaved, freed, and migratory persons of African descent in Canada has always presented a potential source of disruption to that image. An exhaustive volume of leading scholarship in the field of Black Canadian history, Unsettling the Great White North highlights the diverse experiences of persons of African descent within the chronicles of Canada’s past. The book considers histories and theoretical framings within the disciplines of history, sociology, law, and cultural and gender studies to chart the mechanisms of exclusion and marginalization in "multicultural" Canada and to situate Black Canadians as speakers and agents of their own lives. Working to interrupt the myth of benign whiteness that has been deeply implanted into the country’s imagination, contributors use chronological, regional, and thematic analyses to reconsider and uncover new narratives of Black life in Canada. Exploring topics such as settlement, borders, gender, community development, and labour, Unsettling the Great White North contributes to growing historical scholarship on Blackness in Canada and considers the place of resilience and resistance within the colonial legacies of the Canadian nation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

This book, the second of two volumes, offers a magisterial and comprehensive account of the Abbey during the latter part of the thirteenth century, based primarily on evidence in the abbey's records (over 40 registers survive). It begins with an account of the two abbots of this period, Simon of Luton and John of Northwold, who showed outstanding ability in steering the abbey through difficult times, including conflict with the Friars Minor in the town, straitened financialcircumstances (partly caused by oppressive taxation from king and pope), and domestic issues. This is followed by consideration of such matters as the abbey's mint, its economy, religious, intellectual and cultural life, and the abbey's architecture -- especially the charnel chapel constructed by John, which survives to this day. The monks' dietary regime (with examples of actual recipes from the time) is examined in a detailed appendix. Dr Antonia Gransden is former Reader at the University of Nottingham.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

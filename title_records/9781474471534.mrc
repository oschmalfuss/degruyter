They examine both the language of literature as it occurs in a variety of texts from different genres and the language of the classroom as teachers and learners respond in speech and writing to those texts. While giving specific examples from the main literary genres of poetry, short stories, novels and drama, the authors are also concerned with the wider issues that affect all teachers such as assessment, evaluation, planning and working with a syllabus, and teacher development. Exercises and suggestions for further work are included for each section.The book is addressed primarily to students of applied linguistics and practising teachers, and is relevant both to teachers of EFL or ESL and to those who come from a background of literature teaching.Key FeaturesSelective review of relevant work in the fieldCovers the teaching of poetry, drama, short stories and novelsFull bibliography of literary texts usedExercises and suggestions for further work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

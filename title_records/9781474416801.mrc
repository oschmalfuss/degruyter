But when did films start to be displayed in museum galleries? And what are the issues at stake when showing moving images in exhibition spaces? With an innovative and strongly interdisciplinary theoretical framework, this book offers an extensive investigation of the use of audio-visuals in exhibition design. Highlighting the continuities and fractures between different periods, contexts and practices, Elisa Mandelli shows the deep influence of audio-visuals on the configuration of the exhibition space, as well as on the relationship between museums and their visitors.Case studiesImperial War Museum (London, UK)New York Museum of Science and Industry (New York, US)Widespread Museum of Resistance (Turin, Italy)In Flanders Fields Museum (Ypres, Belgium)Trento Tunnels (Trento, Italy)Installation Peopling the Palace (Venaria Reale, Turin, Italy)The Big Picture Show at the Imperial War Museum North (Manchester, UK)Historial Charles de Gaulle (Paris, France)Museum Laboratory of the Mind (Rome, Italy)  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

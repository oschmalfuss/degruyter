The slow crossing by sailing ship was unpleasant even in the best accommodation, but for the poor conditions were wretched in the extreme. Famine, unemployment, poverty drove many from the Old World, and their desperate circumstances made them vulnerable to exploitation at both ends of the journey. In the New World, the immigrant had to adjust to strange conditions as he ventured into the interior of the continent to enter upon the hardships of pioneering. Mr. Guillet has located records never before consulted, found contemporary descriptions not previously used, and presented excerpts from diaries, narratives, letters, and emigrant guidebooks formerly accessible only in museum and archives collections. The illustrations are all from contemporary sources and provide in themselves an authentic and comprehensive picture of the times.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

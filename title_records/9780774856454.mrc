A vivid portrayal of life in some of the most isolated fur trade posts, it describes the intense competition between the North West and the Hudson's Bay companies, the individuals who were involved in exploration and commerce, and, finally, the shocking 'massacre of St. Johns.' It is unique in its integration of historic information and archaeological discovery, as it combines information recovered from many years of archaeological excavation with first-hand impressions of day-to-day life drawn from the few existing journals kept by company clerks. The authors focus not on the elites and middle management, but on the labourers and tradesmen, the wives and the children, whose lives were affected by the fur trade. Written for both a general audience interested in the history of British Columbia as well as fur trade scholars who will appreciate its innovative approach, this book brings new knowledge and insights to the study of this period in the province's history. Prophecy of the Swan also portrays life an archaeological project -- the endless hours of digging, the exacting work methods, and the small rewards inherent in discovery, as well as the mystique and romance that surround such an evocation of history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

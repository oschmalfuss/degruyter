Taking a cue from Jorge Luis Borges’ point that Kafka has modified our conception of past and future artists, and André Bazin’s suggestion that literary concepts and styles can exceed authors and “novels from which they emanate”, this monograph proposes a comprehensive examination of Kafkaesque Cinema in order to understand it as part of a transnational cinematic tradition rooted in Kafka’s critique of modernity, which, however, extends beyond the Bohemian author’s work and his historical experiences. Drawing on a range of disciplines in the Humanities including film, literary, and theatre studies, critical theory, and history, Kafkaesque Cinema will be the first full-length study of the subject and will be a useful resource for scholars and students interested in film theory, World Cinema, World Literature, and politics and representation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

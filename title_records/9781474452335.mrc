This book shows that coal miners occupy a central position in Scotland’s economic, social and political history. It highlights the role of miners in formulating labour movement demands for political-constitutional reforms that helped create the conditions for the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999. The author also uses the experiences of the miners to explore working class wellbeing more broadly throughout the prolonged and politicised period of deindustrialisation that culminated in the Thatcherite assault of the 1980s.Key FeaturesAnalyses the longer history of Scottish coal miners in terms of changing industrial ownership, production techniques and workplace safetyExamines deindustrialisation as a long-running, phased and politicised processUses generational analysis to explain economic and political changeRelates Scottish Home Rule to debates about economic security and working class welfareRelates this economic and industrial history to changes in mining communities and gender relations  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

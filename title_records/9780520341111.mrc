An engrossing story of corporate versus consumer battles over health, safety, and the economic rights of Americans. The future of consumer justice is given wisdom by this eyewitness account.";--Ralph Nadar ";This is a book that should be ready by everyone with a stake in regulation of business by bureaucrats in Washington. Whether you agree or disagree with his point of view--and I often disagree--you can always count on Mike Pertschuk to be provocative, stimulating, and certainly controversial.";--Howard H. Bell, President, American Advertising Federation ";There is a lot of businessmen [sic] to disagree with in this book. It's troublesome and disturbing--not the least because Mike Pertschuk is a tough adversary. But any businessman [sic]--or citizen--who wants to know exactly how the politics of regulation work would be well advised to read this book--and be prepared.";--George Koch, President and Chief Executive Officer Grocery Manufacturers of America ";Must reading for everyone who is a student of the consumer movement, past, present, and future, and its interaction with the government, media, private sector, et al. It is a superb 'How To' manual on tactics, and presents a rare inside look at how things really get done in that place called Washington, D.C.";--Calvin Pond, Vice President, Public Affairs Division Safeway Stores, Inc. ";Pertschuk's book is outstanding; it is a beautiful blend of personal, firsthand observation and political and policy analysis.";--Aaron Wildavsky, University of California, Berkeley ";A rare picture of how government works. . . sprightly, lucid, and appealing . . .remarkably candid and honest, not only in revealing the labyrinthian interplays of politics but in disclosing the author's own attitudes and motives. . . . An extraordinary document.";--Charles Lindblom, Yale University ";There is no more controversial figure in Washington than Michael Pertschuk . . .";--Senator John Danforth  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

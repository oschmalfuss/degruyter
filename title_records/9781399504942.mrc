It is a book which foregrounds the importance of re-historicising women’s creative labour in film, not just as actors on screen, but as voices who have steered the production, circulation and consumption of these films across global contexts.Over three sections, the book provides perspectives on gender representation in East and South-East Asian cinema; new explorations of women’s labour contributions as directors, screenwriters, and editors; and considerations of the contemporary circulation processes through which such work reaches global audiences.By recentring women’s film histories within the broader history of cinema and interrogating the geo-political boundaries of what might constitute ‘East Asia’ in the process, this volume makes a robust intervention into studies of East Asian cinema and women in film.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

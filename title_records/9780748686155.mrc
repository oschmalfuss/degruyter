Dundee had to cope not only with powerful low-wage competition in its staple industry, but the political reality that for decision-makers in London the fate of the British Empire in India was far more important than the economic well-being of a small Scottish city. The history of Dundee’s response to these challenges combines global economic history with analysis of imperial relations, including how these issues were understood by ordinary Dundonians, as well as by politicians and policy-makers. Key featuresNew ‘global’ history of the Scottish city of Dundee’s industrial eraCombines economic, political and social historyExplores the significance of empire for British policyShows how the challenges historically posed by globalization can best be analyzed"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

This book discusses: The controller–processor relationship and what you should pay attention to; How to mitigate security risks in the Cloud to comply with Article 32 of the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation); How to comply with Chapter V of the GDPR when transferring data to third countries; and The implications of the NIS Directive (Directive on security of network and information systems) for Cloud providers. One of the most dramatic recent developments in computing has been the rapid adoption of Cloud applications. According to the 2018 Bitglass Cloud Adoption Report, more than 81% of organisations have now adopted the Cloud in some form, compared with only 24% in 2014. And there are no signs that this is slowing down. The GDPR was enforced on 25 May 2018, superseding the 1995 Data Protection Directive and all local implementations. Bringing data protection into the 21st century, the Regulation expands the rights of individuals, but also introduces new, stricter requirements for organisations. This pocket guide discusses the GDPR requirements relating to Cloud sourcing and the risks involved.

Supplemental material  While most of the EU GDPR’s requirements are broadly unchanged in the UK GDPR, the context is quite different and will have knock-on effects. You may need to update contracts regarding EU–UK data transfers, incorporate standard contractual clauses into existing agreements, and update your policies, processes and procedural documentation as a result of these changes.   We have published a supplement that sets out specific extra o  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

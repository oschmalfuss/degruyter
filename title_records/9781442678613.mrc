Placing contemporary nationalism in historical perspective, the author explores the politics of nationalism and proposes a new theory of exclusive nationalism.While other theories have tended to emphasize the coalescence of distinct languages and nationalities, or the rise of ethnic competition, Chennells' theory focuses instead on the evolution of the political process itself, arguing that the balance of power between state elites and ordinary citizens is a key determinant of the strength of exclusive nationalism. In the process he also addresses such questions as: How has cultural conflict been managed in the Canadian experience? How should liberals view exclusive nationalism? What is the place of large-scale historical surveys, and what are the appropriate methods for them? In tracing the causes of one of the most significant political phenomena of our time, Chennells points to changes in the pattern of political representation and to the paradoxically illiberal effects of popular mobilization. He explores many compelling examples of broad-minded, tolerant statecraft, but does not shrink from difficult and even controversial conclusions. Pronouncing exclusive nationalism illiberal, and existing theories incomplete, Chennells challenges many popular interpretations of key events in Canadian political history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Tuition tends to concentrate either on the written language (never used in everyday speech) or on a selected regional dialect (which is never written down). Arabic Today breaks with this tradition, capitalising on the emerging form of spoken Pan-Arabic. This supraregional form of educated speech is drawn from the most influential areas, as well as the modern written word. So whether you wish to speak the language or add writing skills as well, this course book and accompanying audio website are the ideal tools for self-tuition and classroom use.The second edition of this book has been thoroughly revised and updated to make it relevant to a new generation of readers. Grammar is explained more clearly and precisely, the reading material has been updated and the typography is clearer. New word indexes give meanings and reference for the vocabulary and together with the grammar index they offer an invaluable additional reference function.Key FeaturesTeaches Spoken Arabic in 15 lessons based on dialogue-driven situations with grammatical explanations, examples and exercisesBuilds a vocabulary of c.2000 wordsTeaches Written Arabic in 11 lessons based on the writing system, sentences, and continuous textIncludes a key to the exercises, indexes of Arabic and English vocabulary used, and an index of grammatical subjectsDialogues and exercises are featured on an accompanying audio website which help with pronunciation and fluency in speech and readingAudio material to accompany the book is available at the following website: www.euppublishing.com/page/ArabicToday/audio  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Both practices traditionally require baptism, and either may require confimation/chrysmation as well. But infant communion never requires a measure of 'understanding', whereas child communion does. As yet there is no comprehensive history of infant communion. Several learned attempts were made during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but there were major gaps in their treatment and much that today needs amending. Thanks to the work of JDC Fisher and DR Holeton, many of these gaps have now been filled. I have drawn significantly on their work, as well as on an article of my own in CQR in 1966, but I have also sought to fill in more of the gaps.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

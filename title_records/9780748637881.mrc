Sutton explores Woolf’s interest in the contested relationship between politics and music, placing her work in a matrix of ideas about music and national identity, class, anti-Semitism, pacifism, sexuality and gender. The study also considers the formal influence of music – from fugue to Romantic opera – on Woolf’s prose and narrative techniques. The analysis of music’s role in Woolf’s aesthetics and fiction is contextualized in accounts of her musical education, activities as a listener, and friendships with musicians; and the study outlines the relationship between her ‘musicalized’ work and that of contemporaries including Joyce, Lawrence, Forster, Mansfield and Eliot.Key Features:Analysis of music, national identity and war in The Voyage Out, Jacob’s Room and Mrs DallowayClose reading of Wagner’s influence on the plot and narrative techniques of The Voyage OutAnalysis of music and philo- and anti-Semitism in The YearsInnovative reading of the ‘fugal’ structure of Mrs DallowayListen to an interview with Emma Sutton on ABC's RN here"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

Tabbaa examines the monuments, many of which have vanished in recent years, within the context of the political divisions and theological ruptures that characterised the Islamic world between the 11th and 13th centuries. The writings cover significant forms such as muqarnas vaulting, proportioned Qur’anic scripts and cursive public inscriptions, and monument types such as the madrasa, the hospital, the tribunal (dar al-‘adl) and the citadel palace. Collectively, they present medieval Islamic architecture as a transformative process that echoes Abbasid glory and signals future developments in later Islamic architecture.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

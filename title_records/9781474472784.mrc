The focus then turns to the specific contributions of the philosophers that continue to influence the association of women to politics. These include an analysis of Greek classicists' establishment of andocracy, Rousseau's treatise on education for citizenship, and nineteenth-century ideas of equality.In conclusion, the themes demonstrated throughout are drawn together to show how they translate into contemporary policy on women in politics. Offering an original insight into the ways in which political thought influences political practice, this will be essential reading in a key area of politics, philosophy and women's studies.Key FeaturesExplores the interface between political philosophy and practical politicsCovers key political philosophers over time - Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Mill, Marx, Rawls, NozickUniquely examines the effects of traditional philosophy on the contemporary relationship between women and politics  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

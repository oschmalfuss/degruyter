A third section treats the gases in the atmosphere. An introductory chapter covers the roots of the term atmospheric chemistry in its relations to chemistry in general and biogeochemistry as the chemistry of the climate system. Furthermore, a brief overview of understanding chemical reactions in aqueous and gaseous phase is given. It is my aim to pay respect to all persons who studied the substances in the air, to those who made small, and to them who made giant contributions for the progress in atmospheric science. I’m not a historian who is able to present the past from a true perspective of their time – this also would not be my aim. If possible, however, I try to interpret the past – almost limited to experimental fi ndings in the nineteenth century – through current values, without dismissal of the problems and ideas of earlier scientists. In this way it is possible to draw some ideas on the historical chemical state of the air. Hence, I name this voyage critical. However, nowhere in this book it is my attention to express my criticism to colleagues and scientifi c ancestors. Great scientists too were subject to errors; doing science consists from the permanent loop observation, interpretation, conclusion, and again testing against new observation. If this volume can contribute more than to be “a nice story” on atmospheric chemistry, then hopefully it inspires the reader to more critical reading of scientifi c publications, and, not to forget the older one.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

It is, perhaps, fitting that he have a translator to match. . . The results justify his approach. McCulloch has remained faithful to the essential content, development, and tone of his originals. At the same time, by refusing rigid adherence tot he syntax and vocabulary of each poem, he has allowed himself the freedom to endow his versions with all the force and expressiveness that he has at his command. These are considerable, for he is a gifted poet. His versions possess a rapidity and piquancy unusual in translations. Some of his turns of phrase are quite arresting. In short, his translations are also poems in their own right."; --Classical World This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

Global conflict, political realignments, environmental disruptions, pandemics and disease outbreaks and cyber attacks are a plethora of threats that have and will continue to endanger the stability of the world. Alongside these risks and issues, technological and societal change is ushering in a new age of opportunity and progress. What can organisations and individuals do to prepare for an unexpected future? To prepare for the unexpected future, organisations need to be resilient, and this requires: Understanding the current, emerging and future environments and contexts; People who are knowledgeable, confident and capable in building and maintaining resilience in the organisation and themselves; and A sensible approach to the use of guidance, frameworks and initiative. Phil Wood’s much expanded and updated second edition explores, develops and enhances the concepts discussed in his previous book in granular detail, analysing our understanding of where we have been, where we are now, and where we should be going to develop resilient organisations.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

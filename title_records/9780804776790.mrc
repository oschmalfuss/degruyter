But, you needn't travel far or be a hard core sports fan to appreciate this fact. Whether you play Madden NFL on the Wii, use Nike+ along with your iPod to monitor your workouts, or channel surf and take note of the number of athlete-driven commercials, evidence of this transformation is ubiquitous in today's sports viewing and consuming experience. In recent years, the rapid convergence of sports and entertainment has been key to the sports business industry's continued growth and financial success. Money Games not only analyzes how industry stakeholders have monetized this convergence, but also provides readers with answers to this core question: how can the sports business continue to profit from the blurring of sports and entertainment? Author David M. Carter considers a wide array of implications for television content, video gaming, athlete branding, the Internet, mobile technology, gambling, sports-anchored real estate development, venue technology, and corporate marketing-in short, those areas where business opportunities exist now that sports and entertainment have become one. Money Games is a must-read for professionals and future leaders of the sports and entertainment industries, and sports fans will also find an intriguing story about the evolution of the games that they cherish and follow.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 15.

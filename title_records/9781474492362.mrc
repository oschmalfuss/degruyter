Although highly illuminating, the existing studies fall short of explaining the particularities of numerous singular electoral settings. This gap is especially valid for the grey-zone regimes, which are neither clearly democratic nor conventionally authoritarian in Turkey.Establishing a historical outlook by scrutinising the elections which have taken place since the 1950s, Emre Toros identifies the challenges related to electoral integrity nested at individual and institutional levels. In this way, this book contributes to electoral integrity literature by utilising the valuable research strategies of the existing studies, proposing alternative data sources that will better understand the phenomena and, most importantly, employing a methodology that will suit both singular and comparative cases.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

The book Managing Authentic Relationships; Facing New Challenges in a Changing Context focuses on building and managing a strong network and reciprocal relationships for the entire organization by implementing a professional relationship management approach at strategic, tactical and operational level. Professional relationship management makes valuable and measurable contributions to the strategic goals of an organization by: Expanding the organization's strategy to a Relationship Management Strategy; Efficiently managing relationships and correctly mapping stakeholders; Embedding clear responsibility for relationship management throughout the organization; Measuring results and calculating the Return-on-Relationship; Developing strong networking skills and networkers who are able to act as eyes and ears for the organization; Organizing effective networking activities with measurable results. This book also offers a holistic view. Managing authentic relationships requires a shared understanding of what relationships are. It is impossible to develop successful relationship management without authentic relationships based on trust and reciprocity.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

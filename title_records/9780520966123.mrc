In Politicking and Emergent Media, distinguished historian Charles Musser looks at four US presidential campaigns during the long 1890s (1888-1900) as Republicans and Democrats deployed a variety of media forms to promote their candidates and platforms. New York-the crucial swing state as well as the home of Wall Street, Tammany Hall, and prominent media industries-became the site of intense struggle as candidates argued over trade issues, currency standards, and a new overseas empire. If the city's leading daily newspapers were mostly Democratic as the decade began, Republicans eagerly exploited alternative media opportunities. Using the stereopticon (a modernized magic lantern), they developed the first campaign documentaries. Soon they were exploiting motion pictures, the phonograph, and telephone in surprising and often successful ways. Brimming with rich historical details, Musser's remarkable tale reveals the political forces driving the emergence of modern media.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

John Kendle shows that whatever hopes Irish Unionists cherished of combatting the home rule movement depended in great part on the support of individuals such as Long. Covering the fifteen years during which Long was closely caught up in Irish affairs, Walter Long, Ireland, and the Union, 1905 1920 provides an analysis of Long's attitudes and actions, and underlines his contribution to the resolution of the political and constitutional dilemma confronting the United Kingdom. Kendle concludes that Long, by advocating a federal solution to Anglo-Irish problems, was a principal architect of the partition of the United Kingdom and the post-1922 constitutional map of the British Isles.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

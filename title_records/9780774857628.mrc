Instead of concentrating on the poetry as literature, Podlecki has chosen to examine the life and works of the leading poets of the eighth to fifth century B.C. in the context of the military and historical events of the period. Ranging over the extent of the Greek world at this time, the book is a survey of the many poets who lived in widely scattered places, from Asia Minor in the east to Sicily in the west, who wrote in diffuse poetic idioms, and for varied audiences. Products of different historical and political backgrounds, these poets cannot be appreciated fully, or, in some cases, even understood without considering the milieu in which they lived. On the other hand, their poetry often casts new and interesting light on the historical currents of the archaic period of Greece. Bridging the gap between history and literature, this book will greatly add to the appreciation of the works of these poets and broaden our knowledge of the historical currents and development of thought during this complex period.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

It shows that in his original English poems as well as his translations from Latin, Heaney conjures and transforms familiar Virgilian motifs. The rhythm, pace and musicality of Virgil’s hexameters can be heard in Heaney’s pastoral eclogues and sonnet sequences. And Virgil’s life and times, as well as his poetry, contribute to the shaping of Heaney’s prose poetics. In dialogue with Virgil, as well as other classical and modern poets, Heaney develops his notion of the redress of poetry: the counterbalance that poetry can offer against historical tragedy, suffering and loss.The book explores Heaney’s intensely productive, thirty-year dialogue with Virgil, beginning with his translation of ‘The Golden Bough’ in the 1980s and extending through several major volumes, including Seeing Things, The Midnight Verdict, Electric Light, District and Circle, The Riverbank Field, Human Chain, and the posthumously published translation of Aeneid Book VI.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

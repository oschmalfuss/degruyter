The Daily Telegraph in London published one of the memos with an article headlined 'Egypt protests: America's secret backing for rebel leaders behind uprising'. The effect of the revelation was immediate, helping set in motion an aggressive counter-narrative to the nascent story of the Arab Spring. The article featured a cluster of virulent commentators all pushing the same story: the CIA, George Soros and Hillary Clinton were attempting to take over Egypt. Many of these commentators were trolls, some of whom reappeared in 2016 to help elect Donald J. Trump as President of the United States. This book tells the story of how a proxy-communications war ignited and hijacked the Arab uprisings and how individuals on the ground, on air and online worked to shape history.Key FeaturesIncludes the author’s first-hand perspective of the Arab uprisings which he wrote about from Cairo for The Seattle TimesFeatures interviews with high level insiders, including the American Ambassador to Egypt in 2011, Margaret ScobeyProvides a critical survey and analysis of the use of narrative and counter-narrative theories by the U.S. defence-intelligence sectorDiscusses how the Tunisian uprising was utilised by groups like Ansar al-Shari‘ah in Tunisia and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb to advance a radical Islamic agendaIncludes analysis of new trends in cultural production, including the recent boom in science fiction and popular cinema  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

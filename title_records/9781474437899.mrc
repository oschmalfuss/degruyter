It examines key themes relating to postwar migration by showcasing the experiences of many of Scotland’s most striking immigrant communities of people arriving from England, Poland, India, Pakistan, China, the Caribbean and the African continent. New Scots also features analysis of asylum seekers and refugees, along with Jewish and Roma migrants, and includes a chapter on migrant voting patterns during the Independence Referendum of 2014.Framed in chronological, thematic and international contexts, New Scots offers its readers a penetrating understanding of immigration, one of the most crucial issues confronting the United Kingdom today.ContributorsEona Bell has held post-doctoral positions at the SOAS Food Studies Centre and SOAS China Institute, and is working on a book about Hong Kong Chinese families in Scotland.Stefano Bonino is the author of Muslims in Scotland: The Making of Community in a Post 9/11 World, published by Edinburgh University Press in 2016.Christopher J.

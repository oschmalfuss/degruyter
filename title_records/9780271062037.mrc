This dissemination offered a radically democratizing potential for accessing, interpreting, and deploying learned texts. Focusing primarily on an overlooked sector of Chaucer's and Gower's early readership, namely, the upper strata of nonruling urban classes, Lynn Arner argues that Chaucer's and Gower's writings engaged in elaborate processes of constructing cultural expertise. These writings helped define gradations of cultural authority, determining who could contribute to the production of legitimate knowledge and granting certain socioeconomic groups political leverage in the wake of the English Rising of 1381. Chaucer, Gower, and the Vernacular Rising simultaneously examines Chaucer's and Gower's negotiations-often articulated at the site of gender-over poetics and over the roles that vernacular poetry should play in the late medieval English social formation. This study investigates how Chaucer's and Gower's texts positioned poetry to become a powerful participant in processes of social control.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

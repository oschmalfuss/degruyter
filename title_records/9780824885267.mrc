Stone first used Tetua as narrator of Polynesian legends in THE SHIP OF FLAME. The stories he tells, handed down through the generations by word of mouth, are to him as familiar and comforting as old friends.The stories in this volume are not literal translations of ancient songs and myths, but are rather presented, as the author points out in his preface, “in such a way that they might have living reality for a reader who has little or perhaps no personal familiarity either with Polynesian peoples or with Polynesian islands.” as Tetua weaves the spell of Tahiti, we come to know “the youths and maidens and men and women not as so many strange means but as real human beings.”  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

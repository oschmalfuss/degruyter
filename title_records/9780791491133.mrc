(1906–1993) was a pioneer in the meeting of faiths and of cultures in the second half of the twentieth century. This captivating study of his pioneering work in intercultural and interreligious dialogue draws from meticulous research of Griffiths's writings and his sources, as well as numerous personal interviews with the man himself.Born in England, Griffiths immersed himself in Western culture through an Oxford education and twenty-five years in Benedictine monasteries. Yet early mystical experiences in nature and the study of Asian scriptures sparked a life-long search for what he called "the other half of my soul"—a search that would in 1958 take him to India. After participating in two Christian monastic experiments, he accepted leadership of Saccidananda Ashram, a community dedicated to pursuing the recently renewed Christian contemplative ideal in an India context. Here he boldly explored interreligious dialogue and inculturation, two projects of the Second Vatican Council. Envisioning "the marriage of East and West" in his writings and incarnating that marriage in spirituality, Griffiths became a prophet of our age, publishing more than a dozen books and scores of articles. In latter years, Griffiths attracted large audiences and received recognition from fellow pioneers in the dialogue of faiths, including the Dalai Lama.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

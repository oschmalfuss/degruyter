The history is complete, beginning with the earliest settlement and ending at a period in which Oakville has changed its character completely. It is based on wide research, begun out of genuine interest and curiosity, into a part of the province about which very little has been written. Mrs. Mathews has combed such primary sources as family papers, local newspapers, and archive documents. She has given an intimate picture of the people, houses, and public buildings of Oakville, and of activities along "The Sixteen," The creek which has been so important in its life. But Mrs. Mathews does more than this. She places the development of the village and town in its proper setting in Ontario history, with the result that the reader learns not only about Oakville but about the social history of southern Ontario over a long period.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

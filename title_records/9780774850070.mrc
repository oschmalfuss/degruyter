Riddell-Dixon relates the findings of her study to two broad concerns in the literature on Canadian foreign policy-making. First, she assesses the relative importance of developments in the international arena on the one hand, and of domestic pressures on the other in determining foreign policy. Secondly, she considers the effectiveness of government efforts to democratize foreign policy. Canada and the Beijing Conference on Women concludes by offering some points for NGOs to consider when developing lobbying strategies, as well as points for government officials to take into account when considering measures to facilitate NGO participation in the policy-making processes for future world conferences. Full of interviews with the key players involved, this book will interest scholars in Canadian foreign policy, women's studies, public policy, as well as diplomats and public servants.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Between 1948 and 1963, British policymakers used intelligence as a tool to maintain British influence in Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iran.Discover how Britain tried to influence regional intelligence and security services and shape their approach to countering communist subversion. However, amidst disagreements over the nature of the threat and levels of brutality used to counter it, intelligence and secret liasons ultimately failed to protect Britain’s waning influence.Key FeaturesReveals that Britain was instrumental in creating and training Middle Eastern security services, which often engaged in human rights abuses, and examines Britain’s complicity in these aspectsSheds new light on MI5’s activities overseas; MI5’s roles and activities were not only confined to the British Empire, but also areas outside the colonial territories in the Middle EastOffers an insight into intelligence liaison based on different political systems – the relationship between democratic (British Intelligence and Security Services) and non-democratic governments (their Middle Eastern counterparts) – and also another aspect of intelligence liaison as the means of influencing the policy of a foreign governmentBased on the thesis that won the BRISMES Leigh Douglas Memorial Prize for the Best PhD Dissertation on a Middle Eastern topic for 2014  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

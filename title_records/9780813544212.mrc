Against the third ranked team in the nation, on a perfect autumn evening, the Scarlet Knights stormed back from 18 down, with Coach Greg Schiano's vaunted defense shutting down Louisville's passing attack. As Jeremy Ito's kick cleared the uprights with seconds on the clock, the Scarlet Knights announced their arrival as one of the most fearsome teams in the nation. Rutgers Football: A Gridiron Tradition in Scarlet is a richly illustrated history of one of the most storied programs in all of college football. From the first intercollegiate contest against Princeton in 1869, which started college football as we know it, through the years that Paul Robeson suited up for the team, the famous undefeated season of 1976, and right up to the Schiano era, former Scarlet Knight Michael Pellowski takes you on a fascinating journey that chronicles the highlights of the first 137 years of Rutgers football. He makes special mention of the Scarlet Knights who have gone on to successful careers in the NFL-Brian Leonard, Mike McMahon, L.J. Smith, Gary Brackett, Ray Lucas, Deron Cherry, among others-and includes a complete listing of letter winners. Now, with the Empire State Building being lit red in the team's honor, and fans believing that a national championship is within reach, Rutgers Football: A Gridiron Tradition in Scarlet provides the indispensable backstory for this team as it "chops" its way to future greatness.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 04.

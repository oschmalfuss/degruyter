Especially in terms of vulnerable populations, acknowledging these influences proves crucial to effective assessment and help.Drawing on extensive empirical research, this volume provides the necessary concepts, tools, and techniques for culturally and socially inclusive practice with vulnerable female populations. After a brief history of substance abuse among women in the United States, along with an overview of previous epidemiological study, An-Pyng Sun systematically describes the characteristics and nature of AOD problems among pregnant women, teenage girls, older women, street-walking prostitutes, homeless women, and lesbians. Clearly and concisely, she presents the theories that explain women's AOD problems, along with their related risk factors, and recommends effective treatment guidelines and strategies that speak directly to the needs of individual clients. Vulnerable women are more likely to develop substance abuse problems than other women, and their consequences tend to be more severe. This volume organizes complex data into a practical framework so practitioners can successfully respond to this special population. It supplies a long-overdue, comprehensive, and comprehensible knowledge base for screening, assessment, and care.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

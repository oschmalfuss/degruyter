This forthright book examines the aims of health care programs and suggests some realistic solutions to the obstacles that must be overcome.Based on the work of a survey team sponsored by The Rockefeller Foundation, the study analyzes health problems on a world scale, whenever possible using examples from countries observed. Dr. Bryant advocates a systems-analysis approach to national health planning, pointing out the interrelationships of health planning and national development. He gives special attention to manpower needs, and develops the concept of a health team that would include paramedical as well as professional personnel. He also proposes a plan for medical education that would be devoted to meeting a particular country's needs and related to its system of health care.The author's findings and recommendations are essential reading for everyone concerned with the health and development of emerging countries. Written in a clear, compelling style, the book is enhanced by illustrations by the young Thai artist, Praphan Srisouta.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

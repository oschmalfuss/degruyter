Now Mary Roth Walsh explores eighteen current controversies, presenting two opposing views on each subject, all from recognized experts representing psychology, psychiatry, sociolinguistics, education, sociology, law, and management science. Walsh provides an introductory essay, individual introductions to each topic, and more than 1800 bibliographical citations. The format of this book is based on Walsh's Psychology of Women: Ongoing Debates, which was published in 1987 to great acclaim. Women, Men, and Gender presents new issues and up-to-date articles that are of relevance to the general reader and today's students of gender studies. IntroductionI.

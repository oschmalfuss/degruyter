This book provides a rigorous framework for understanding some of the most controversial films of the past twenty-five years.The term ‘transgressive art film’ designates the phenomenon of a small number of controversial films recuperated each year by the cinema art world as part of an expansion of the definition of film art. Rather than seeing controversial films as aberrations, this book suggests that transgressive art films should be understood as a socio-cultural phenomenon and a central plank of cinema’s need for newness, innovation, and renewal. By paying attention to all scales of cinema, from close analysis of individual frames, through the discourse constructed around them, up to global distribution and film-festival networks, Transgressive Art Films details how certain kinds of cinematic transgression gain wide-ranging institutional support rather than being ignored or forgotten.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

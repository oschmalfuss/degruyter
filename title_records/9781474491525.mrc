Connecting debates on critical military studies, transitional justice and memory studies, the book moves beyond the conditions of implementation of accountability measures. It examines the conditions of possibility of the global anti-impunity agenda: when, how and why the question of impunity came to dominate debates on large-scale political violence.Drawing lessons from the Brazilian case, the book provides a new reading of transitional justice, investigating alternative ways of understanding militarism in the absence of warfare. It reveals the ways in which narratives of accountability and the memory of militarism work to demarcate and restrict what counts as unacceptable violence, who counts as victims/perpetrators and what counts as reasonable forms of justice and resistance.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

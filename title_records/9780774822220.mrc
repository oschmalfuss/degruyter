But only a few have explored what happened when governments turned the taps back on. Dan Malleck shifts the focus to Ontario following repeal of the Ontario Temperance Act, an age when the government struggled to please both the "wets" and the "drys," the latter a powerful lobby that continued to believe that alcohol consumption posed a terrible social danger. Malleck's investigation of regulation in six diverse communities reveals that rather than only pandering to temperance forces, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario sought to define and promote manageable drinking spaces in which citizens would learn to follow the rules of proper drinking and foster self-control. The regulation of liquor consumption was a remarkable bureaucratic balancing act between temperance and its detractors but equally between governance and its ideal drinker.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

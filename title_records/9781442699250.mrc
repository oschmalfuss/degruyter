His two terms as president of the United Steelworkers of America, from 1983 until 1994, capped off a career in labour relations spanning nearly five decades. Among his many notable achievements were the new bargaining techniques he developed to face challenges from anti-union politicians such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Williams also played a major role in the structural readjustment of the North American steel industry during its most turbulent period, the 1980s and 1990s.In his memoirs, Williams vividly recounts his life in labour, with all its triumphs, challenges, hopes, and dreams. While telling his own story, Williams also traces the rise and transformation of the labour movement from the Second World War to today. Providing an insider's perspective on union developments and issues, One Day Longer is a profound reflection of Williams's impressive career.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

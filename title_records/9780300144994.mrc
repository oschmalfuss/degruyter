The first of its kind, Worlds Apart? Disability and Foreign Language Learning offers critical and practical essays with insights applicable across the language-teaching spectrum. Written in English, Worlds Apart? brings together scholars and teachers from around the world who examine foreign language education from general requirements through advanced literature and film courses to study abroad, showing how to enable the success of students with disabilities at every step of the way. Thought-provoking chapters explore the nature of language itself, the best avenues toward acquiring proficiency, and the lives of disabled people at home and abroad. Worlds Apart? Disability and Foreign Language Learning offers fresh, new perspectives on the inquiries into culture and diversity undertaken in the academy today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

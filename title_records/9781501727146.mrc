More and more faculty members are taking their cases to court, charging illegal employment discrimination in reappointment, tenure, and promotion decisions. How can individual faculty members defend themselves against unfair practices, and how can universities and colleges protect themselves from being named in employment discrimination lawsuits? What factors precipitate lawsuits? What position have the courts taken on intervention? What evidence do the courts consider persuasive in such cases?Paying particular attention to equal employment opportunity legislation, Terry L. Leap discusses the results of more than twenty years of promotion and tenure litigation and provides a comprehensive chart of relevant cases. He also analyzes the rationale used by the courts in adjudicating these cases and suggests ways colleges and universities can reduce the likelihood of suits.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

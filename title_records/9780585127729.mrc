A notable feature of the guide is its inclusion of journal articles, book chapters, essays, and doctoral dissertations, as well as complete books. All book entries are annotated. Information regarding specific definitions, the relevance of topics, and related research interests is interspersed throughout. Each of the thirteen chapters begins with a list of topics covered, followed by the entries themselves organized alphabetically within each topic. An introductory chapter includes a helpful "How-to," while the concluding chapter provides guidance in researching the field. In-depth subject and author indexes allow the user to identify specific areas of interest quickly and easily.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

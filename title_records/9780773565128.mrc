A number of public figures of the 1950s and 1960s came into prominence during the convention, most notably Joseph R. Smallwood, leader of the confederate group. This unique and remarkable historical document is a must for Commonwealth and Canadian specialists and research libraries.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

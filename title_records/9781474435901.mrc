Bringing into conversation postcolonial and post-communist migration narratives from Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe, it aims to capture the emergent shift from national to postnational European space. Through its examination of cultural texts, including works by Jamal Mahjoub, Mike Phillips, Laila Lalami, Mahi Binebine, Dubravka Ugrešić and others, this book traces EU neocolonial practices in relation to European history, borders and guiding ideals of community, which exclude various 'others' from their symbolic imaginary. The book deliberately moves the discussion away from social-scientific approaches to humanities and offers a fresh intellectual framework for understanding multicultural identity in Europe.Key FeaturesGoes beyond traditional frameworks of cultural analysis (national, ethnic, or language-based) by focusing on narratives which take the European Union as a point of referenceShifts focus from narratives depicting interactions between different cultures to those imagining communities of solidarity based on common economic or historical marginalisation in the European UnionRevises postcolonial theory by arguing that the European Union exemplifies a new, ‘consensual’ regime of colonial governanceOffers poststructuralist readings of migrant narratives to go beyond the more common, multicultural approaches to such narrativesDevelops original perspectives on individual writers (Jamal Mahjoub, Mike Phillips, Laila Lalami, Mahi Binebine, Dubravka Ugrešić, and others)Helps reorient European Union studies, dominated by social sciences, to the humanities side  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

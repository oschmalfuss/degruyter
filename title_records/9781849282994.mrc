Fail to plan and your business may fail. Would your business survive a major incident? What if your key staff were suddenly unavailable? What if your premises were to become uninhabitable? What if your systems and data failed altogether? Would your business ever recover? At what cost? Business Continuity Management: Choosing to survive shows you how to systematically prepare your business, not only for the unthinkable, but also for smaller incidents which, if left unattended, could well lead to major disasters. A business continuity management (BCM) program is critical for every business today, and this book will enable you to develop and implement yours to maximum effect. An effective BCM program will have a positive impact on your business, not only enabling you to carry on 'business as usual' in the event of an incident, but also in its day-to-day running. You will realize: improved organizational performance improved stakeholder confidence (including shareholders, customers, supply chain) competitive advantages financial savings increased profits. With specific reference to ISO22301, ANSI/ASIS SPC.1-2009, ISO27031 and ISO/IEC 24762, this up-to-date, practical resource will guide you through all the elements of a BCM program, plans and implementations. It covers all the critical elements of your business, from people and premises to technology and facilities management.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

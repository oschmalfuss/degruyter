This is the first ever Flora of the Glasgow area that relates how plants have changed over time. It is based on the results of some fifteen years' intensive research by members of the Glasgow Natural History Society and other field botanists working under the direction of Professor Jim Dickson, Dr Peter Macpherson and Keith Watson. The survey led to discoveries of many special plants, including some thought to be extinct, and revealed sites of great scientific and conservation interest. The book also uncovers some little known aspects of the city's natural, social and economic history and their bearing on wild plants.The Changing Flora of Glasgow is generously illustrated with photographs, maps, and paintings, many of them in colour, and including several sequences to show places and perspectives as they are now and how they were some 250 years ago. It combines immaculate scholarship with an accessible, entertaining style. An essential reference work for botanists and plant lovers, it will also be a much-read possession in homes in Glasgow and surrounding areas.With The Changing Flora of Glasgow, you can:Discover how and why Glasgow's flora has changed since records began Consult a catalogue of 1500 speciesIdentify plants previously thought extinctCompare Glasgow's plant life with that of other European citiesExplore current conservation issuesEnjoy the lavish illustrations  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

In this book Thomas Farrell addresses two problems within TESOL teacher education – the perceived gap between theory and practice and the lack of contact with newly qualified teachers. Farrell outlines how to prepare for the realities of what you will face when beginning your career through reflective activities that include: case-based teaching, teaching metaphor analysis, critical incident analysis, and teacher identity analysis. Including data-based vignettes from diverse contexts of language teachers, you are able to gain practical insights from language teacher education courses. Whether a learner teacher or teacher educator, this book presents new insights into the reality of TESOL teacher education.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

Employing theoretical frameworks from New Film History, it offers a fresh look at underrated or neglected cultural products to provide insights into Greek modernity and reveal the affinities of established Greek auteurs with the film-noir tradition. Firmly establishing Greece on the film noir cinematic map, it provides a panoramic overview of leading Greek auteurs, from Nikos Koundouros and Maria Plyta to Theo Angelopoulos and Nikos Nikolaidis, whose work is innovatively viewed from an angle of film-noir style and thematics.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

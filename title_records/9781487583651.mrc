For this reason they have been divided. The Canadian papers were considered of such importance that the Toronto Public Library Board of Trustees, assisted by the generosity of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the University of Toronto Press, has undertaken their publication, under the editorship of the late Chief Librarian, Charles Rupert Sanderson, LL.D., M.A., B.Sc. They were first published in six paper-bound parts, and then in the present three volumes. The mood of Volume Two is noticeably calmer. As the imminent danger of attack from without and within receded, the question of the future form of government of the colony became predominant. In the spring of 1839 Lord Durham's Report reached Upper Canada, and its recommendations aroused heated controversy. Sydenham's appointment confirmed the belief that the report was going to be implemented, and Volume Two ends with the passing of the measure for union in both houses of the Upper Canadian legislature.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

This pedagogical method provides an organizational framework within which the primitive elements and concepts of music can be introduced, experienced, and explored, and auditory discrimination developed. The process of improvisation is the focal point of the Schulwerk. Castner suggests that the numerous educational benefits of improvisation can be obtained in geographic education by the process of "mapping." He defines mapping as graphic description, analysis, and presentation in a problem-solving context. After more than two decades of research in cartographic communication, Castner concludes that success in examining and analysing landscapes, and images representative of them, is dependant upon developed skills in visual discrimination. Seeking New Horizons describes a rationale for linking basic visual discriminations to their logical extensions in the concepts that are fundamental to geographic thinking, thus providing challenging approaches to developing spatial awareness, graphic literacy, and geographic understanding. In addition, Castner identifies eight basic concepts which would allow students and teachers to work interactively with spatial information and, over time, with increasingly complex and sophisticated tools and at increasingly abstract levels of generalization.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

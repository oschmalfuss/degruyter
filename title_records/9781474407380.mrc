Are phonological features innate and universal, and do they have fixed phonetic correlates? These questions have recently received renewed prominence in theoretical debates, and this book explores them from a modular, substance-free perspective. This in-depth analysis of Breton serves not only to introduce previously underused data into the theoretical landscape but also to demonstrate the viability of a modular framework for phonology. The book introduces a minimalist system of phonological representations built up on a language-specific basis, without regard to the phonetic realisation of phonological objects, and integrates it with a fully-fledged computational framework and a stratal interface between phonology and morphosyntax, showcasing the numerous empirical and conceptual advantages of a substance free view of phonology.Presenting the first comprehensive analyses of the sound patterns of a Breton variety treated in a substance-free phonological framework, this book will enhance the understanding of Celtic phonology and offers a valuable reference for postgraduate students, academics and researchers working in phonological theory and Celtic studies. Key FeaturesPresents an in-depth treatment of Breton phonology in a generative framework, focusing on traditional varieties rather than the standardised written language (unlike most theoretical work to date)Introduces previously underused data into the theoretical landscapeRe-establishes the value of non-trivial phonological representations after a period of theoretical neglect and at a time when formal phonological theory is under pressure to accommodate new empirical findings from variationist and laboratory approaches  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

It argues for increased and radical change by the tourism industry and claims that this change is made necessary by the emergent sophistication and increased experience of tourists who require a different style of treatment and type of product. Dynamic Tourism is presented as a formula to meet the needs of the prevalent consumer society, to cater for its changing wishes, to reflect society’s contemporary concerns and to accommodate the ongoing projected growth of tourism. The focus is upon the tourist, highlighting the need for the tourism industry to give greater consideration to tourists’ changing needs, and to take a more flexible, modern and thought-out approach. The argument is delivered in three parts. First, the book indicates why Dynamic Tourism is needed as a method, and shows its first signs of appearing. It then delivers the detail and practicality of the process. Finally, the complete concept is outlined and the method of future implementation is projected. Examples from around the world are used to explain and illustrate the argument. Underlying the whole discussion is the recognition that the tourism arena is a resource of finite size, needing capacity for renewal and requiring the most intelligent, adaptable and considered use. The intended readership for this book includes all participants in the tourism experience: the tourism industry, its policy makers, operatives and stakeholders, and those students who intend to join their ranks, existing tourists who are disappointed with the limited provision offered to them at present and who wish for better in the future, along with the increasing number of new tourists whose outlook is very different from those of the past.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

After the First World War, both men had repu­ta­tions as being liberal, pro-American jour­na­lists. This book explores their papers and inves­ti­gates their wartime acti­vi­ties and connec­tions, and shows how they helped the German-Ottoman Alli­ance to take root.

Ernst Jäckh was a consul­tant to Emperor Wilhelm II in his Eastern affairs and made several trips to the Ottoman Empire. In the process he built up a repu­ta­tion as being »Turkish-Jäckh« among German impe­ria­list circles due to his Young Turkish connec­tions. Through their writings and the various insti­tu­tions they enrolled, they both became key figures of the German-Ottoman Alli­ance. Also by evalua­ting the writings of the Ottoman political elite of the Era on Germany this book shows how the so-called »German spirit« was constructed by the Ottoman political elite, inclu­ding Ahmed Emin. It also clari­fies how certain elements of German natio­na­lism were appro­priated into Turkish natio­na­list thin­king by the channel of German impe­ria­lists, inclu­ding Ernst Jäckh. Oppo­sing the comview that the support for the German-Ottoman Alli­ance was limited only to a certain clique of the Committee of Union and Progress, this book seeks to answer how the »main­st­ream intel­lec­tuals« of the Second Consti­tu­tional period who supported the Alli­ance protected their repu­ta­tions after World War I, and how this German-Ottoman Alli­ance gave Turkish natio­na­lism a German  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

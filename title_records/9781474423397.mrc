And did you know that many Ottomans applauded the establishment of a quarantine against the disease in 1838 as a tool to resist British and French political and commercial penetration? Or that later Ottoman sanitation effort to prevent urban outbreaks would help engender the Arab revolt against the empire in 1916? Birsen Bulmus explores these facts in an engaging study of Ottoman plague treatise writers throughout their almost 600-year struggle with this epidemic disease. Along the way, she addresses the political, economic and social consequences of the methods they used to combat it.Key FeaturesStudies the premodern ways in which plague was viewed by Ottoman Islamic thinkersTraces the eventual Ottoman acceptance of quarantines and other modern medical reformsAnalyses international debates over plagues and quarantines as a struggle about colonialism and national sovereignty"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC 3.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

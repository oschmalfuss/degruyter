Inspired by the philosophies of rhetoric and social discourse in the work of Kenneth Burke, Roger Fowler, Wayne Booth, and George Dillon, Deer forcefully engages the politics of postmodernism in its theoretical and literary dimensions by reading against the grain of canonizing criticism. He provides a detailed discussion of the connections between postmodern literary forms and world views and focuses particularly on how novels are scripted to influence readers and what kinds of world and social views are being promoted. Combining the ethical focus of Wayne Booth and Gerald Graff with elements of deconstruction, Deer's specialized readings of the novels imaginatively construct the addresser-addressee relations of texts and explicate narrative authority. This study will be of particular interest to students of Canadian literature and literary politics as well as scholars of rhetorical theory and criticism.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Caring for the World assembles the stories, experience, and advice of prominent global health practitioners in this inspired guidebook for health care workers who are interested in - or already are - improving the lives of people throughout the world.Providing a wealth of valuable resources and information, the authors detail how individuals can find and prepare for global health work as well as how to obtain education and funding from governmental and non-governmental organizations. Skillfully addressing important issues related to working within other countries and cultures, they also provide practical advice on how to understand pandemics and the HIV/AIDS crisis in order to effect change.Accessible, thorough, and concise, Caring for the World is essential reading for anyone interested in global health work, non-governmental organizations, and the current state of global health care.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

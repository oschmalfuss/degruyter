It features the first person accounts of rescuers and of survivors whose stories address the basic issue of individual responsibility: the notion that one person can act-and that those actions can make a difference. These rescuers are true heroes, but modest ones. They did a thousand ordinary things-opening doors, hiding and feeding strangers, keeping secrets-in an extraordinary time. For this, they are known as "Righteous Among the Nations of the World." The rescuers and survivors are from many countries in Europe-Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, Bulgaria, Poland, Germany-and they tell their stories with simplicity and dignity. Each story is interwoven with old snapshots of rescuers and survivors, their homes, their hiding places, and the communities in which they lived. Noted author, teacher, and human rights activist, Elie Wiesel, helps us to ask: "what made these people different?" He points out how those who helped Jews during the Holocaust "changed history" by their actions. The Courage to Care reminds readers of the power of individual action. This compelling book is the companion volume to the award-winning film, The Courage to Care, and includes the personal narratives of the same persons in the film and many others.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

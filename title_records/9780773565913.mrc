He captures the traditional way of life in the North before the dramatic changes of the last half century. A member of the last expedition in the Canadian North to depend on traditional techniques, Rowley recounts how they lived as the Inuit did and travelled by dogsled over unexplored land. He describes the isolation, the extraordinary vicissitudes of travel in a sometimes savage environment, and the generosity and kindness of the Inuit. Apart from completing the map of Baffin Island's coastline and finding new islands, Rowley excavated the first pure Dorset site near Igloolik, establishing the Dorset culture beyond doubt. The carvings and artifacts found there, illustrations of which are included in this book, remain among the best and most beautiful that have been recovered. Based on his own diary and the diaries of other members of the expedition, Rowley's captivating story presents the perceptions of a young man faced with a completely alien, yet fascinating, environment and culture. A true and often exciting tale of discovery, Cold Comfort will appeal to a wide audience as well as to those concerned with the Arctic in general. It is an invaluable source for those who specialize in the archaeology, anthropology, geography, and history of northern Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

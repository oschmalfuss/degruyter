This is the first UK book to specifically focus on violent fathering discussing original research in the context of domestic violence and emerging practice literature to address this problem. The book examines fathers' perceptions of their domestic violence and its impact on children, their relationships with children and their parenting practices. It will be of interest to academics and professionals in family and child welfare policy, socio-legal studies, social work, criminology and other disciplines with an interest in domestic violence and child protection.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

Mark Ain led Kronos Incorporated from concept to the basements and garages of its early core team to a soot-filled ironworks foundry, and from there to its eventual role as a multi-billion-dollar global leader in an industry it refined, then redefined, and ultimately led. The story of Mark Ain and Kronos holds inspiration and insight for any aspiring entrepreneur.The tale starts not in a boardroom, but with Mark's early upbringing, where his adventurous spirit and fearless nature readied him to be both a risk-taking business pioneer and a leader who recognized the need to take a nontraditional approach to team building, prioritizing fit over resumes and potential over past accomplishments. The result was a company that could and would truly stand the test of time.His guiding philosophy of "If it isn't broke, fix it anyway!" applied in equal measure to the products and solutions Kronos provided to its ever-expanding customer base and to the way the company was structured and operated to consistently reinvest in its employees.Kronos, today known as the Ultimate Kronos Group, is now a multi-billion-dollar global organization of almost 13,000 employees. And Mark, the epitome of a triumphant business creator, has decided the time is right to share his own experiences to inspire a next generation of like-minded visionaries.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

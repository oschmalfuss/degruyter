It explains how Victorian literature both gave expression to pro-imperialist themes, and engaged with forms of opposition to the empire like abolitionism and early Indian nationalism. Victorian literature is analyzed in relation to key debates in postcolonial studies about Orientalism, race, gender, Marxism, subalterneity, imperial historiography, mimicry and representation. And there are in-depth examinations of works by major Victorian authors in an imperial context, notably those of Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, Disraeli, Tennyson, Yeats, Kipling and Conrad.'As a useful compendium for students of culture and imperialism, Victorian Literature and Postcolonial Studies also forcefully reminds Victorianists that they cannot afford to ignore empire in their analyses . The astonishing breadth of works discussed, the range of themes and issues covered, and the extensive bibliographical references appended will make this book an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the intertwined intellectual genealogies of Victorian and postcolonial studies.'Gauri Viswanathan, Class of 1933 Professor in the Humanities, Columbia University'Brantlinger gives a lucid, compelling and witty account of the relations of British imperialism and Victorian literature. He shows how central the Empire was in the cultural production of both canonical and 'genre' literatures, and establishes a wide archive that is of considerable value to students and researchers . He gracefully combines literary, cultural, theoretical and historical dimensions, allowing readers to apply and test the tenets of postcolonial cultural theory by placing it in dialogue with primary materials.'Laura Chrisman, Professor of English, University of Washington  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

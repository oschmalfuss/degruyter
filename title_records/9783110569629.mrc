The author, who has been actively involved in the development of a new chemistry curriculum in The Netherlands and is currently chair of the Committee on Chemistry Education of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, offers an overview of the existing learning models and gives practical recommendations how to implement innovating strategies and methods of teaching chemistry at different levels. It starts at the beginner level, with students that have had no experience in secondary schools as a teacher. After a solid background in the theory of learning practical guidance is provided helping teachers develop skills and practices focused on the learning process within their classrooms. In the fi nal chapter information is given about the way teachers can professionalize further in their teaching career. Addresses innovative teaching methods and strategies. Includes a section of practical examples and exercises in the end of each chapter. Written by one of the top experts in chemistry education. Jan Apotheker taught chemistry for 25 years at the Praedinius Gymnasium, Groningen. In 1998 he became a lecturer in chemistry education at the University of Groningen, retired in 2016. He is currently chair of the Committee on Chemistry Education of the IUPAC.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

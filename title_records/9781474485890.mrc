This journey led him into an intensive study of a number of different thinkers, ancient and modern, including Plato, John Scotus Eriugena, Duns Scotus, Hegel, Schelling, Peirce, Whitehead and Collingwood.James Bradley was Professor of Philosophy at Memorial University, Newfoundland from 1988 to 2012. His work was a lifelong examination of themes in speculative metaphysics within a broad historical context. Throughout these investigations, Bradley remained focussed on a single project: the elaboration of the triadic structure of speculative logic, expressed in both Christian theology and more metaphysical terms. Bradley was convinced that he had discovered the key to ontology and the history of philosophy, theology and science in the logic of the Trinity.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

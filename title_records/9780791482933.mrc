Countries have become increasingly aware of the "borderless" nature of environmental issues, i.e., that production and consumption in one country can spill over to affect another country's environment. Protecting Our Environment considers the successes that have been achieved in the European Union (EU), as well as issues the Union still faces regarding the protection of the environment in the future. Authors Janet R. Hunter and Zachary A. Smith identify the factors that have allowed the EU to form a successful environmental regime, including the development of the environmental management approach and the principles upon which it is based. They examine in detail the challenges that have been encountered in the implementation of environmental programs, and the solutions that have been developed to address those challenges. Also considered is how economic development and environmental protection have been reconciled within the EU. By analyzing the successful example of the EU, Protecting Our Environment provides a model for a contemporary approach to global environmental problems.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

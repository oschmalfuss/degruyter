By giving a voice to Oneida women's thoughts on tradition and nation, this book challenges mainstream feminist ideas about the masculine bias of Western theories of nation and about the dangers of nationalist movements that idealize women's so-called traditional role. Lina Sunseri shows that feminist insights, although useful to many women's and feminist groups, cannot be applied universally to all women or to societies with traditional forms of nation based on good relations between men and women. Oneida women do not view nationalism as a threat but rather as a way for women and men to be again of one mind.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

It focuses on comparative sources derived from public and media visual campaigns focusing on migration issues. It illustrates how the ethical gap that the host-centric way of looking creates results in the growing suspicion of the migrant and how this ethical gap broadens and impacts on the legal exclusion of migrants as legal subjects.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

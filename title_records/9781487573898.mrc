Cassidy, Professor Frank H. Underhill, and Professor John S. Morgan, from each of whom I received helpful advice. The topic first considered was child welfare, but some exploration revealed that programmes for the protection of children emerged rather late in the total structure of welfare services in the province and could hardly be assessed until earlier developments in the broader field had been examined. It was thus decided to carry out a study of the whole field of social welfare, with particular reference to the ro1e played by the provincial government.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

This text gives equal prominence to all three missions. It therefore includes some advanced material as well as the customary introductory topics and is designed to be studied over an extended time-frame. The problem-solving aspects are developed more fully than in many other texts; showing readers how problems are approached and bringing out the ways of going about constructing a model and solution.Features:* Includes some advanced material as well as the customary introductory topics * The problem-solving aspects are developed more fully than in many other texts; showing readers how problems are approached and bringing out the methods of going about constructing a model and solution  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

It encourages an ‘interactional’ rather than a ‘speaker focused’ language development approach. Drawing on corpus data, it exposes students to the most salient and widely used vocabulary and grammar, illustrates the most effective conversation maintenance and communication strategies and draws attention to the socio-cultural aspects of communication. Campus Talk comprises two textbooks. Each textbook contains four instructional units and each unit is based on situations and conservations that students will come across in their everyday lives on campus. In this volume, units 5-8 cover areas such as sharing, delivering and engaging in a conversation story, making and responding to a complaints and apologies, building rapport and managing interacting with an audience, keeping your audience focused, making and responding to an invitation and to compliments and understanding and responding to humor. Each unit includes:Enabling, input-based and interactional tasks and activities Usage-informed vocabulary list Main production task Self-assessmentWith a variety of challenging tasks and activities and plenty of opportunities to practice and engage in self-reflection and self-assessment, students using these books will grow their confidence and enhance their abilities to express themselves clearly, appropriately and effectively. The workbooks are aimed at upper-intermediate and advanced learners of English (CEFR B1-C2) to promote interactional language awareness and develop active listening skills."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

While men in reserved occupations are understood as extensively influenced by ‘imagined’ discourses, often resulting in feelings of guilt and emasculation, their subjectivities were nonetheless ultimately rooted in their ‘lived’ and immediate local vicinities, and the people and places of their everyday lives. This ultimate relevance of lived existence and the everyday also meant that while wartime relations between men and women were clearly shaped by a range of gender discourses and continually renegotiated, gender boundaries were never fixed or truly separate.The analysis looks at wider subjectivities, encompassing national and political identities, class consciousness, religious subjectivities and social activities, as well as examining women’s experiences of working in reserved occupations in wartime and their interactions with civilian men.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

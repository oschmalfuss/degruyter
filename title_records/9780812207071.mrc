Illuminating the competitive world of graduate education funding in the arts, humanities, sciences, and engineering, the book offers general and specific information in an intelligent, comprehensive, and straightforward manner so that readers can save time and make winning grant and fellowship applications.The authors include detailed descriptions of the types of funding offered graduate students, ranging from tuition scholarships to assistantships, work-study opportunities, and university loan programs. In addition, the handbook thoroughly covers the availability of nationally prominent grants and fellowships through the federal government and private organizations. This revised third edition provides a wealth of additional information and advice and details a number of new grant opportunities including several aimed at women, minorities, and other underrepresented student groups. Covering fellowships and grants for individual training, study abroad, research, dissertations, and postdoctoral work, the book includes useful addresses, deadlines, number of available awards, number of applicants, purpose of grants and restrictions, duration of awards, applicant eligibility, and application requirements. The information is comprehensive, detailed, and current, based on data from funding agencies through interviews, review of application packets, web site information, and the authors' many years of experience in the field.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

The composition of the atmosphere is changing, the ozone shield is being depleted, marine life is threatened by pollution and over-exploitation, and rapid population growth in certain areas has created an alarming imbalance between population and resources. As the wealthy industrialized nations grow richer, they spread their waste around the world. What will be the fate of the poorer nations and what will their relationship be to the wealthier nations if the gap between them continues to grow?Rodney White's clearly written, accessible book describes the basic scientific changes taking place in the environment in ways that can be understood by non-scientists. It covers such key topics as global warming, acid rain, management of the oceans, water supply, urbanization, waste management, and use of land for food and energy. The book will be of interest to all who are concerned about environemntal issues, those who set government policy, employees of development agencies, and teachers and students in the many courses that are growing up around this complex subject area.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

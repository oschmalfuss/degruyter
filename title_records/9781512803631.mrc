By reason of its sheer volume, and also because of its concentration within a few hours of the day, this rush-hour travel presents to planners and engineers critical problems relating to the location and capacity needs of streets and highways, and transit and parking facilities. The patterns of work trips also comprise important determinants of maximum reasonable distances between residential areas and the dusters of commercial and industrial enterprise. This monograph presents analytical approaches to the study of the journey to work--primarily in development of the patterns of its time and scale characteristics. Such patterns are considered in relation to population size of cities, and in terms of their apparent changes and factors for change over the years. The approaches discussed are those of interest to technicians working in the prevalent low budget; high time­-pressure situation. Examples are analyzed from data of several United States cities, particularly Philadelphia, and broad general conclusions are drawn from the case studies. Supplemented by numerous diagrams and numerical tables, Structuring the journey to Work will be of interest to traffic engineers, city and regional planners, urban geographers, and industrial and residential site selectors. It will have some interest as well for professionals in land economics and labor market analysis.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

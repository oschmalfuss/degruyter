Accepting Alexander Korda's invitation to join London Film Productions, he travelled the world, making such memorable films as The Private Life of Henry VIII, Elephant Boy, The Four Feathers, and Scott of the Antarctic. Through his daring and innovative photography, Borradaile, whom Raymond Massey called "the greatest exterior camera artist in the world," enhanced the work of such major filmmakers as Cecil B. De Mille, Alexander Korda, Robert Flaherty, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, and Otto Preminger. Life through a Lens, the personal journey of a great adventurer and artist, will be of interest not only to film historians but to anyone captivated by the cinema.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

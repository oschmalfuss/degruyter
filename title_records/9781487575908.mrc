Its concern is not with the mechanics of government, but with the practice of politics at the local level. Its focus, moreover, is on seven specific political systems at the heart of what are arguably the most important metropolitan areas in Canada. This book marks the beginning of an effort to specify what is distinctive about Canadian politics at the munisipal level, in relation to practice at other levels and in ther countries. The essays that form the core of City Politics in Canada were commissioned from leading authorities on local politics in the citizes concerned: Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Helifax, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Edmonton. The result is a set of accessible and highly informative essays, each written from a different perspective and based on a diferent approach to the subject, but each contributing to a general portrait of Canadian city politics. Warren Magnusson's introductory essay is itself a sketch for such a portrait. Especially designed for readers who are new to the subject, this essay reviews the development of local government and politics in Canada as a whole. It explains those features of municipal politics that the authors of the case studies have had to take for granted, and it sets the context for comparative analysis. Such analysis is Andrew Sancton's concern in his concluding essay. He bases his observations on the studies in this book, and pays particular attention to the way in which the pattern revealed differs from the American and the British. As he says, Canadian city politics is almost exclusively about boosterism, land development, and the enhancement of property. This is its unifying and distinguishing feature -- a feature that is clarified by the analyses in each chapter of City Politics in Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

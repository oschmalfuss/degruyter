She highlights the struggle between the Jesuits and Natives over the meaning of Christianity. The Jesuits' attempted to convey their Christian message through Native languages and cultural idioms. Blackburn shows that this resulted in the displacement of much of the content of the message and demonstrates that the Native people's acts of resistance took up and transformed aspects of the Jesuits' teachings in ways that subverted their authority. Harvest of Souls is essential for all those interested in new approaches to historical and contemporary relations between Europeans and Native peoples in North America.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

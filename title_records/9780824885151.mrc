He resided with King Kamehameha for three months of his stay, so that his account describes both the life of the king's household and that of the commoners. Campbell's is one of the fullest pre-missionary accounts of Hawaii.This volume, published on behalf of the Friends of the Library of Hawaii, is a facsimile reproduction of the third American edition, the full title of which is "A Voyager Round the World from 1806 to 1812; in which Japan, Kamschatka, the Aleutian Islands, and the Sandwich Islands were Visited; Including a Narrative of the Author's Shipwreck on the Island of Sannack, and His Subsequent Wreck in the Ship's Long-Boat: With an Account of the Present State of the Sandwich Islands and a Vocabulary of Their Language."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

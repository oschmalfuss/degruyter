It is also intended for that considerable number of persons whose chief interest in meteorology is the study of clouds. The author deals in turn with classification of clouds; the materials of which clouds are composed; the process of cloud formation; the nuclei of condensation and sublimation; the problem of precipitation release (including discussion of rain-making experiments); the methods and equipment employed in observing clouds; the relation of clouds to flying; their significance with regard to forecasting; the special forms of cloud found at very high levels in the atmosphere; and the optical and electrical phenomena associated with clouds. For the benefit of non-technical readers, a glossary of technical terms is appended. There is a bibliography, and subject and author indexes have been included. This book is illustrated with diagrams and photographs; the latter are from a number of different sources, including the author's own cloud photographs.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

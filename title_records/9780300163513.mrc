This highly acclaimed book by an eminent Arabist focuses on the development of Sunni Muslim fundamentalism, discussing how it rejected Western values, broke with pan-Arabism, and took on an activist political position. This enlarged edition contains a new chapter, “In the Shadow of Khomeini,” which considers the growth and influences of Shi’ite radicalism since the Iranian Revolution, reviews the principal areas of controversy between Sunni and Shi’ite Muslims, and assesses whether rapprochement between the two groups is likely. Review of the earlier edition: “Sivan . . . not only introduces Western readers to scores of important but little-known contemporary Islamic thinkers, . . . He also breaks new ground in his analysis of their work and activities.”-Shaul Bakhash, Wilson Quarterly “A gem of a small book. . . . Sivan writes clearly, dispassionately, and with enviable command of his subject. His book makes a large and almost entirely new body of information available.”-Daniel Pipes, The New Leader “Not just scholars but everyone seriously interested in the contemporary Middle East is in Sivan’s debt.”-G.H. Jansen, Los Angeles Times “This study by Emmanuel Sivan is exceptional; it is professional, insightful, and persuasive. . . . A well-informed interpretation of recent events based directly on relevant Arabic writings.”-Michael W. Dols, History “Thorough, thought-provoking, and very instructive.”-William M. Brinner, Middle East Review Emmanuel Sivan is professor of history at Hebrew University and editor of the Jerusalem Quarterly  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

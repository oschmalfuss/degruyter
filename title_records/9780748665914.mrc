While much film theory has looked at desire in terms of (visual and spectator) pleasure, Barbara Kennedy suggests, in this provocative new study, that these different perceptions of 'body' are responsible, as well as the brain/mind, for the ways in which visual elements of colour, movement, rhythm and sensation are acquired within, through and beyond our consciousness.Film is visceral, vital and dynamic, and wider frameworks of understanding are needed to explain these aesthetic resonances. Deleuze and Cinema asks: how can we begin to understand the cinematic experience as one of material capture, processuality and movement - as opposed to a spectator/text relationship - where desire and pleasure are part of a complex 'aesthetics of sensation'?Through discussions of Orlando, The English Patient, Romeo and Juliet, Strange Days and Leon the book offers a new and creative collusion between Deleuzian philosophy - specifically Deleuze's ideas about desire, pleasure, sensation, affect and 'becoming-woman' - and contemporary film studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

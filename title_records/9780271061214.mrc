Yet, despite the sale of over thirty million copies of her works, there have been few serious scholarly examinations of her thought. Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical provides a comprehensive analysis of the intellectual roots and philosophy of this controversial thinker. It has been nearly twenty years since the original publication of Chris Sciabarra's Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical. Those years have witnessed an explosive increase in Rand sightings across the social landscape: in books on philosophy, politics, and culture; in film and literature; and in contemporary American politics, from the rise of the Tea Party to recent presidential campaigns. During this time Sciabarra continued to work toward the reclamation of the dialectical method in the service of a radical libertarian politics, culminating in his book Total Freedom: Toward a Dialectical Libertarianism (Penn State, 2000). In this new edition of Ayn Rand, Chris Sciabarra adds two chapters that present in-depth analysis of the most complete transcripts to date documenting Rand's education at Petrograd State University. A new preface places the book in the context of Sciabarra's own research and the recent expansion of interest in Rand's philosophy. Finally, this edition includes a postscript that answers a recent critic of Sciabarra's historical work on Rand. Shoshana Milgram, Rand's biographer, has tried to cast doubt on Rand's own recollections of having studied with the famous Russian philosopher N. O. Lossky. Sciabarra shows that Milgram's analysis fails to cast doubt on Rand's recollections-or on Sciabarra's historical thesis.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

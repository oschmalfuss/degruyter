Moreover, organizations often confuse availability with capacity, and assume incorrectly that using cloud services reduces the need to manage these factors. Lessons from real projects in a narrative format In Availability and Capacity Management in the Cloud: An ITSM narrative, Daniel McLean’s fictional IT service management practitioner, Chris, faces the challenge of integrating cloud services into an ITSM structure. Based on the real-life experience of the author and other ITSM practitioners, this book tells the story of a cloud services implementation, exposing potential pitfalls and exploring how to handle issues that come with such projects. Tips to help you through your own project The end-of-chapter pointers give useful advice on dealing with the challenges organizations face when considering cloud services. Read this book and see how Chris meets the challenge of integrating cloud services with ITSM, and how you can do the same. Learn from the successes.

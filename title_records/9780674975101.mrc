By uncovering and documenting the enormous contributions that women had made—previously overlooked or underappreciated—this important reference work changed the way historians thought and wrote about American history. This latest volume brings the project up to date, with entries on almost 500 women whose death dates fall between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 1999. The era they shared coincides with the great expansion of opportunities for women in the twentieth century. You will find here stars of the golden ages of radio, film, dance, and television; scientists and scholars; politicians and entrepreneurs; authors and aviators; civil rights activists and religious leaders; Native American craftspeople and world-renowned artists. Women from a broad spectrum of ethnic, class, political, religious, and sexual identities are all acknowledged. For each subject, Notable American Women offers a substantial interpretive biographical essay by a distinguished authority that integrates the woman’s personal life with her professional achievements set in the context of larger historical developments. This volume will be an indispensable reference for students and scholars of women’s history and for anyone interested in the rich and varied lives led by distinguished American women.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 25.

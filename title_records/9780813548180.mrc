What most adults do not know is that the juvenile justice system has become much more punitive in the last fifteen years. No longer is juvenile court a place where regardless of what happens you get a clean slate when you turn eighteen. Today almost every adjudication of delinquency is accompanied by adult-style fingerprinting, prior record score points, and DNA tests that can stay in a state repository for years. For every stage of the justice system, from arrest to expungement, When Kids Get Arrested gives "top tips" to help adults make the best choices to protect children from long-term negative consequences. Sandra Simkins provides straight answers to common questions such as: Should I let my child talk to the police without a lawyer? How can I help my child succeed on probation? Should my child admit to the charges or take the case to trial? How will this case impact my child's future? Will it prevent him from getting a job or going into the army? My child has mental health issues. Can the juvenile justice system help? My daughter is out of control. Should I call the police? My son got arrested at school and is now suspended. What should I do next? Simkins takes complicated legal concepts and breaks them down into easy-to-understand guidelines. She includes information on topics such as police interrogation, detention hearings, and bail, along with state-by-state specifics. When Kids Get Arrested is a perfect resource for parents, social workers, guidance counselors, teachers, principals, coaches, and anyone else who works with children.   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

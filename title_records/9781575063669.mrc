It focuses on the Project's efforts in Field II during three excavation seasons between 1977 and 1980. Field II was opened on the central summit of the tell in order to examine the ancient city's intramural stratigraphy. The excavations uncovered twelve phases and sub-phases of occupation, stretching from the end of the Late Bronze Age to the late Roman period. Included were six phases of Iron Age domestic architecture (Strata VIIB-A and VID-A) revealing especially the vitality of the Iron II Judahite settlement during the 9th and 8th centuries B.C.E. In addition were remains of a substantial 6th- to 5th-century Persian fort or residence (Stratum V), as well as successive phases of 4th- to 2nd-century Hellenistic occupation (Stratum IV). Surface traces provide evidence of resettlement at the site during the late Roman period in the 2nd century C.E.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

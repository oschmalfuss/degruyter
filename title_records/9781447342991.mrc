The new edition of this bestselling textbook critically examines the potential and reality of closer ‘working together’ and asks whether such new ways of working will be able to respond more effectively to the needs and aspirations of children and their families. The fully updated second edition also explores the experience of working in a constantly changing environment and the impact of change on workplace cultures and on children and their families, and policy towards parenting and concepts for practice. It includes a new introduction with a helpful overview of current key issues and new case studies to illustrate the reality of practice today . This book contributes to crucial debates about the knowledge and skills essential for work with children and with parents in the childcare, health, social care and educational children’s services.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

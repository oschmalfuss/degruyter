Using personal diary entries between 2002 and 2006, Darlene K. Drummond details her life-altering decision to undergo gastric bypass surgery. Drummond, an African American woman diagnosed as morbidly obese, diabetic, and hypertensive, describes her family history of chronic illness and obesity and shares conversations with health professionals, family, friends, coworkers, and support groups both before and after the procedure. She also includes her weekly grocery expenses, out-of-pocket medical expenses, reactions to media stories on celebrity personalities battling complications of obesity, as well as chronicles of the cognitive and behavioral changes she experienced along the way.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

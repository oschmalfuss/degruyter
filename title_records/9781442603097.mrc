MacIvor surveys this situation and the extent to which it is changing but offers as well a much broader approach to the subject, recognizing the impossibility of separating the roles played by women in politics from their part in Canadian society generally, MacIvor looks also at such topics as the structure of the economy, of the family and of popular culture. Women and Politics in Canada sets the stage for a discussion of the Canadian situation by exploring ideas about women in Western thought and the various feminist approaches that have arisen in response.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

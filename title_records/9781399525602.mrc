William Dick established his veterinary school in 1823. The development of his veterinary interest, formal training and family life is presented. About 14,000 students from at least 139 countries have studied towards obtaining undergraduate veterinary degrees and/or postgraduate qualifications (diplomas, masters, doctorates) from the Dick Vet, Gamgee’s Edinburgh New Veterinary College, and Williams’ New Edinburgh Veterinary College, Polish Veterinary Faculty and the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine. The progressive changes in course duration, content, staffing and physical facilities are described. The student populations, graduations, dress codes, extra-curricular activities and traditions give insights into the lives of veterinary students over two centuries. The academic and clinical leadership of the individual veterinary teaching and research institutes is described. Some indication is given of administrative, teaching and support staff. The geographical location of veterinary education in Edinburgh is highlighted.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

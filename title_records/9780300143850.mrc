In showing the corrupting influence of material things upon its members, O`Neill would provide "a prophetic epitome for the course of American destiny." Quoting extensively from unpublished notes, outlines, scenarios, and drafts, and incorporating detailed plot summaries, this book tells for the first time the complicated story of the cycle project. It shows what the dramatist tried to do, how he went about it, and why in the end he failed."A Tale of Possessors Self-Dispossessed" began as a single play about a clipper ship, set in 1857 and 1858, but it expanded eventually to eleven plays going back to 1754 or 1755. O`Neill completed to his satisfaction only one play (published posthumously as A Touch of the Poet), although he drafted-and then destroyed-three other double-length plays and prepared a detailed scenario for a fifth. Yet the project`s failure contained within it a victory, for in 1939 O`Neill cast off his obsession with his cycle and went on to create such masterworks as The Iceman Cometh and Long Day`s Journey into Night, A Moon for the Misbegotten, and Hughie.Henry McBride Series in Modernism and Modernity  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

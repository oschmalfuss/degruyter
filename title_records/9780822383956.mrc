The living risk losing everything, but what they hold onto-love, faith, hope, truth-might change the world. It is this subversive possibility that speaks through these poems. A succession of voices-exiles, activists, separated lovers, the families of those victimized by political violence-gives an account of ruptured safety. They bear witness to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of personal and social damage in the aftermath of terror. The first bilingual edition of Dorfman's work, In Case of Fire in a Foreign Land includes ten new poems and a new preface, and brings back into print the classic poems of the celebrated Last Waltz in Santiago. Always an eloquent voice against the ravages of inhumanity, Dorfman's poems, like his acclaimed novels, continue to be a searing testimony of hope in the midst of despair.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 12.

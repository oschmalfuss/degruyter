MacQueen assessing and contextualising Sellar’s contribution to the field David Sellar was a pioneering historian of Scots law who rejected previous interpretations of the subject as a series of false starts and rejected experiments. He emphasised instead the continuity of legal development, with change a process of integration of external influences from very early times on. Sellar’s approach, articulated mainly through essays published in diverse places over four decades, significantly influenced our general understanding of legal history in Scotland as well as leading to appreciation elsewhere of its comparative significance. By gathering Sellar's major essays in a single collection, this book demonstrates the scope and reach of Sellar’s overall contribution. It provides an opportunity to view Sellar’s work as a whole and to access his distinctive perspective on the overall trajectory of Scottish law.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

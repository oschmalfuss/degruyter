Buy this book to learn how to revolutionise your Agile development and increase the value and relevancy of your project outcomes. Learn 30 realistic, achievable ways that an Agile business analyst can increase project efficiency, add value and improve quality. Find out how an Agile business analyst bridges the gap between the needs of the business and the resources of the development team. Now updated with current Agile methods, to support emerging and established business analysts to adapt to new trends. Support your Agile business users for better project outcomes In The Power of the Agile Business Analyst, Jamie Lynn Cooke challenges this approach and questions whether Agile projects that are run in this way can deliver the highest-value business solutions. Agile developers can access a wide range of resources to help achieve their project goals. In contrast, the Agile business user often has very little support despite holding key responsibilities, such as gathering requirements, managing priorities and providing business knowledge to ensure the best possible solution. The business user also usually has wider responsibilities that make it difficult to give a project their full attention. 30 ways an Agile business analyst can help Drawing on her extensive experience, Jamie proposes a new role for Agile projects: The Agile business analyst. She details 30 achievable ways that such a role will increase relevance, quality and overall business value, and provide business users with crucial support. The Agile business analyst is also a boon to the development team, being a ready source of business knowledge and ensuring that project outcomes align with requirements. This book has been updated to: Incorporate behaviour-driven development into the work that the business analyst does to support interface design; Align the programme management strategies of the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to encourage cross-organisational communication and participation; Include full updates throughout the Qualifications section in ‘Getting the Right Agile Business Analyst for Your Team’; and Provide Agile updates, bringing the book back into line with current methods. Jamie Lynn Cooke has 27 years of experience as a senior business analyst and solutions consultant, working with more than 130 public and private sector organisations throughout Australia, Canada, and the United States.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

His exploration of Christianity as an unforeseen and unforeseeable event in which the mystery became a man reveals how, by acknowledging this fact, an individual is simultaneously able to use reason and be moved by affection. Discussing the ways in which Christ continues to be present in history through the companionship of those whom He joins to himself in Baptism, Giussani illuminates how a sense of Christ's mercy can overcome negativity and encourage a useful life. A profound and moving work, Generating Traces in the History of the World will interest all those who have been inspired by Giussani's thought.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

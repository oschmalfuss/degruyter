Unlike free indirect discourse, FCN does not refer to current acts of consciousness, but to typical, characteristic segments of the character’s text. There are two main modes of FCN: contagion of the narrator’s discourse with a character’s text, and the more or less ironical reproduction of a character’s text in narrative discourse. In the latter case, the narrator’s criticism may refer to either the content of the character’s text or to its form of expression. This study begins with a definition and an example of FCN as a narrative device, followed by an analysis of terms used for FCN in German, Anglophone and Russian literary criticism. Building on the perception of FCN as a phenomenon of interference between narrator’s and character’s text (text interference), this book analyses the function and applications of FCN in narratives written in German, English and Russian.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

"For tasting one of the well-springs of a peculiarly American version of higher learning, Yale: A History is clearly to be recommended to readers anywhere. It will be read with profit as well as enjoyment."—Times Higher Education Supplement "Kelley sustains [his] theme well and reconstructs the institutional development of Yale with considerable skill and empathy. . . . A very informative book."—Journal of American History "Useful both for those primarily interested in Yale as an institution and for students of the history of higher education generally."—The Historian "A readable, accurate synthesis of Yale's internal history, fully comparable to the best single-volume treatments of other major universities."—Times Literary Supplement  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

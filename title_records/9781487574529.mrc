The book is a simplified restatement of the theory and practice of appraising with particular reference to Canada; it concentrates on those aspects of the theory which are of practical importance and draws on examples basic in concept. This new edition brings the text completely up to date, taking into account changing economic conditions. Three new chapters discuss important developments in accepted appraisal theory: one discusses the Ellwood concept and related aspects of mortgage-equity analysis and capitalization; the other two examine the economic theory underlying real property value, explain the theory and its importance in the market, and suggest ways in which accepted appraisal theory can be made to conform with accepted economic theory. The simplicity of expression and example which made the first edition so popular has been retained in this revision and the discussions have been kept as brief and lucid as possible.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

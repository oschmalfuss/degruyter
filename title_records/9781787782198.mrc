ITIL 4 has evolved to a value system-focused approach that can be integrated with other management practices and ways of working, such as Agile and DevOps. Its end-to-end digital operation model has been designed to help IT teams create, deliver and operate technical products and services that fit their organisation’s wider business strategy. ITIL® 4 Essentials contains everything you need to know to pass the ITIL 4 Foundation Certificate, plus more. It covers practices and concepts that are not addressed as part of the Foundation syllabus, making it ideal for newly qualified practitioners. The book offers practical tips – based on the author’s extensive experience – for applying service management in the real world, with symbols used throughout to highlight which content is related to the ITIL 4 Foundation syllabus and which is not. Ideal for self-study candidates and training participants, ITIL 4 Essentials will prove a helpful companion to their studies and a practical aid for their professional development. Project managers, contractors or consultants with limited study time will also find it essential to their part-time education. This second edition has been updated to align with amendments to the ITIL® 4 Foundation syllabus, including: Replacing ‘change control’ with ‘change enablement’ throughout; The removal of ‘IT’ from the definition of a change; and Updating definitions for customer, sponsor and user. A perfect companion before, during and after your ITIL exam – buy your copy today. ITIL® is a registered trade mark of the PeopleCert group. Used under licence from PeopleCert.

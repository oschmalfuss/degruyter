In response, Moralities of Drone Violence aims to provide greater clarity by exploring and ordering a variety of ways in which violent drone use can be judged as just or unjust in various circumstances. The book organises moral ideas around a series of concepts of 'drone violence': warfare, violent law enforcement, tele-intimate violence, and violence devolved from humans to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In contrast to the way armed drones tend to be debated narrowly in terms of war and law, this broad-based approach to normative inquiry affords more scope to discern and address the potential for these weapon systems to support moral progress or to generate injustice.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

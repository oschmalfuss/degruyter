As the wife of the British Ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Liston had privileged access to the Ottoman elite and diplomatic corps. Her journal reflects on British–Ottoman relations, combining Orientalist perspectives with a human-centred version of the picturesque. It offers astute commentaries on places, people and events – including a plague-ridden Constantinople, a visit to the harem of the Grand Vizier’s deputy, the presentation of ambassadors in the Seraglio and the departure of pilgrims on the hajj.This edition features Liston’s journal alongside a selection of her other, shorter writings relating to her time in Turkey, including accounts of diplomatic incidents and personal experiences. It offers an innovative coupling of print publication, providing a modernised, accessible edition of Liston’s travel writing with supporting critical apparatus, alongside an online resource containing a complete set of digitised images of the original manuscripts and semi-diplomatic transcriptions.Find out moreWatch: 'Henrietta Liston: Approaching Constantinople, 1812-1820' on YoutubeExplore: 'The North American journeys of a diplomat's wife: The journals of Henrietta Liston, 1796–1801', the online resource from the National Library of Scotland"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

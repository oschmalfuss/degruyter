She also examines how Davies' playwriting has been influenced by the dominant tastes of his time and by the conditions under which his plays have been performed. Dealing with the plays chronologically, Stone-Blackburn reveals Davies' fondness for theatricality as opposed to realism, for mythic flavour and archetypal character, his romanticism, and his irrepressible humour.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

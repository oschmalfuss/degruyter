For more than twenty years she remains in China, separated from her husband, taking care of his family members and struggling to survive during a turbulent period of Chinese history. To escape political persecution Sau-Ping flees to Hong Kong and spends three years enduring the appalling conditions of a refugee. With the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act she is finally reunited with her husband in Canada, but her struggle continues as she tries to rebuild her life with a husband she barely knows in an alien culture she does not understand. The Excluded Wife gives voice to the first generation of post-war Chinese immigrant women, capturing the tragedy, courage, and triumph of those women who made the epic journey from China to Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

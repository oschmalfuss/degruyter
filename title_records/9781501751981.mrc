How did Roman Catholics go from being perceived as un-American to becoming the most vocal defenders of the United States as the standard bearer in world history for political liberty and economic prosperity? D. G. Hart charts the development of the complex relationship between Roman Catholicism and American conservatism, and shows how these two seemingly antagonistic ideological groups became so intertwined in advancing a certain brand of domestic and international politics.Roman Catholics, contrary to the standard narrative, were some of the most assertive political conservatives directly after World War II, and their brand of politics was one of the most influential means by which Roman Catholicism came to terms with American secular society. They did so at precisely the same time that bishops determined the church needed to update its teaching about its place in the modern world. Catholics grappled with political conservatism long before supposed rightward turn at the time of the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973.Hart follows the course of political conservatism from John F. Kennedy, the first and only Roman Catholic President of the United States, to George W. Bush, and describes the evolution of the Church and its influencet on American politics. By tracing the roots of Roman Catholic politicism in American culture, American Catholic argues that Roman Catholicism's adaptation to the modern world, whether in the United States or worldwide, was as remarkable as its achievment is uncertain. In the case of Roman Catholicism, the effects of the religion on American politics and political conservatism are indisputable.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

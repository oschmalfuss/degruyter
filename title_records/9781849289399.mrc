Dave Jones (Director & Principal ITSM Consultant, UK) Only by understanding IT-driven business services and anchoring them in a service design statement (SDS) can enterprises translate business needs into IT-intensive business services. In Collaborative Business Design – Improving and innovating the design of IT-driven business services, Brian Johnson and Léon-Paul de Rouw comprehensively explain how to use business service design (BSD) to formulate an effective SDS that will help business and IT cooperate to create robust, efficient services that support business requirements. The book delves into the inner workings of services, with the aim of making sure that each side – business and IT – understands the other’s needs and drivers so that services can deliver what is required, expected and promised of them throughout their lifecycle. It: Examines the gap in understanding between IT and business. Introduces Business Service Design (BSD) – an analytic approach to understanding the characteristics of IT-driven business services. Provides an overview of the different components that must be analysed to obtain insight into the characteristics of IT-driven business services and to anchor these insights into a Service Design Statement (SDS). Considers the different parts of the BSD and SDS. Explores how to obtain insight into the design of IT-driven business services using BSD. Discusses practical consequences for business transformation to continually define, develop and improve robust services that customers want to use. More than ever, applications software (what consumers call 'services'.) reaches deep into everyday business processes. In order for the modern business to grow or simply to secure market position, rapid and efficient service development and IT delivery is demanded from IT suppliers. This book offers valued insight to strengthen the alliance between business and IT. Perry van der Weyden (CIO, Rijkswaterstaat, Netherlands) Wickedly funny in many places, well researched and pragmatic. Highly recommended.' Olafur Gunnarsson (President, Rema Tiptop, USA) BSD is not an architecture for software development or for technology support – it complements existing frameworks such as TOGAF, IT4IT, BiSL® Next and ITIL® by focusing on business architecture, a subject rarely described before designing an IT-intensive, complex business service. BSD is moving the conversation from IT as an operations center to more of a key component of the business’s genetic makeup. This book is a must read if you want to cement an alliance between business and IT.

He traces Gustafson's development from an early, adolescent romanticism to his later modernist and post-modernist approaches, and situates this progression in the context of the general shifts in poetic approach and theory which took place during the same period. A Poetics of Place surveys not only the life of a poet but the evolution of literary sensibilities from the thirties to the eighties. Rather than force Gustafson's work into a theoretical matrix, McCarthy has avoided critical jargon and fads of literary theory and has focused on Gustafson as a writer, providing a perceptive and detailed analysis of all the major poems and volumes. McCarthy shows Gustafson's appreciation of the local -- his "poetics of place" -- to be a distinguishing feature of his genius. McCarthy allows the reader to return to the poetry itself.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

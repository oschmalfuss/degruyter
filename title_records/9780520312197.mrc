His study focuses on a vast and little known region that includes southern Tanzania, northern Mozambique, and Malawi, with extension north along the Swahili coast and west as far as the Lunda state of the Mwata Kazembe. He examines both the competition between traders and their internal impact on the various societies of East Central Africa. Alpers' main concern is to demonstrate that the historical roots of underdevelopment in the area are to be found 'in the system of international trade which was initiated by Arabs in the fifteenth century, seized and extended by the Portuguese in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, dominated by a complex mixture of Indian, Arab and Western capitalisms in the nineteenth century'. Thus this readable and original book places East African trading systems within the larger Western Indian Ocean system and in the world capitalist system.

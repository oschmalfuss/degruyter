It shows where Islamic economics converges with and differs from conventional economics through the banning of usury and other Shari'ah-prohibited trade practices.Islamic finance rests on the principles of free market exchange of Islamic economics. But the latter has failed to keep pace with the rapid developments of the former. Much work published about Islamic economics is at least idealistic if not radically ideological, with little relevance to the Islamic financial industry. This book provides the coherent body of economic theory that students and practitioners of Islamic finance need in order to understand how the maqasid gives a sense of direction to developments in the industry. Key FeaturesDeparts from the common conceptual grounds of market behaviour shared by the maqasid approach and the conventional approach to economicsClearly explains the maqasid economic rationale of precluding interest rates on money capital from legitimate economic exchangeStudents can track their progress with learning outcomes, chapter previews, chapter summaries and revision questions  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

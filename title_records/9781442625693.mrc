On Freedom, Love, and Power is the transcription of a series of talks given by Ellul in 1974 in which he refines and clarifies some of his most controversial insights on the Jewish and Christian Bibles and their relevance to contemporary society.This expanded edition of Ellul’s talks features additional material, previously unavailable, that focuses on Christianity’s potential service to humanity as a community that exemplifies a society where people are reconciled with one another and with God.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

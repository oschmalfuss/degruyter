These individuals do their work in such a remarkable way as to become a model for others. This book is based on a study of the beliefs, actions, and interactions of a group of extraordinary oncology nurses—the people their peers would choose to have care for them if they were diagnosed with cancer. Perry’s weaving of interviewee’s stories and her own field notes and poetry creates a very personal perspective on nursing that leaves the reader with a greater understanding of the experience, and rewards, of caring for others.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

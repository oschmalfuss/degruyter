This broader perspective allows Bumsted to show, for example, that the decision to distribute land to proprietors was a comprehensible and even liberal move by British government in the context of the imperial expansion of the 1760s. Bumsted demonstrates that the external influence of the American Revolution is more important than had been thought, both in isolating the island from Britain and, through the handling of Loyalist immigrants, in exacerbating the conflicts over land ownership. Previously, Prince Edward Island's crucial formative period from 1763 to the end of the eighteenth century has not received sufficient attention, while the proprietorial system has received too much attention without sufficient critical analysis. Land, Settlement, and Politics on Eighteenth-Century Prince Edward isalnd redresses the balance.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

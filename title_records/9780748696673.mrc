Nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy source and therefore can contribute to reducing the effects of climate change. However, it is also faced with issues of high start-up costs, risk and waste disposal. Drawing on over 90 interviews completed across Belgium (Brussels), Romania, the United States, and the United Kingdom, this book focusses on the development and formulation of energy law and policy in civil nuclear energy in the EU, the US and beyond. Heffron deconstructs the constituent parts of effective energy law and policy within the complex and often controversial energy industry. Pulling out what has and what has not worked, he suggests ways to improve the delivery of the central aims of law and policy.About the AuthorRaphael Heffron is a Lecturer in Law at the University of Leeds, an Associate Researcher with the Energy Policy Research Group, University of Cambridge and a Policy Fellow in the Policy Fellows Network at the Centre for Science and Policy, University of Cambridge. He is a trained Barrister-at-Law and was called to the Bar in July 2007 in the Republic of Ireland.Raphael's research interests are in energy law and policy, and in particular: electricity markets, energy subsidies, low carbon energy, energy justice and Arctic energy law. He has published in many energy law and policy journals such as: Oil, Gas and Energy Law; International Energy Law Review; Journal of World Energy Law and Business; Technology Forecasting and Social Change; Energy Policy and Applied Energy.Visit Raphael J.

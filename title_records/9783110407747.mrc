The first section of the book, Revelation, explores Rabbi Nachman’s spiritual revelations, personal trials and spiritual experiments. Among the topics discussed is the powerful “Story of the Bread,” wherein Rabbi Nachman receives the Torah as did Moses on Mount Sinai – a story that was kept secret for 200 years. The second section of the book, Rectification, is dedicated to the rituals of rectification that Rabbi Nachman established. These are, principally, the universal rectification, the rectification for a nocturnal emission and the rectification to be performed during pilgrimage to his grave. In this context, the secret story, “The Story of the Armor,” is discussed. The book ends with a colorful description of Bratzlav Hasidism in the 21st century.   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

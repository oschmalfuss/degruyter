While emphasizing the importance of taking an intersectional approach to women’s healthcare, this book also focuses on the social and structural determinants at play. This revised and updated second edition brings together a collection of new chapters and contributors who collectively shed light on the problems and risks involved at perceiving women’s healthcare using a strickly "gender" or "sex" based lens. The book not only challenges the privileging of gender norms, but also deepens and extends intersectional theorizing and analysis of health care. Contributors foreground an understanding of power as it is mediated through a range of social relations based on gender, race, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, ability, class, geography, and the ways in which privilege and oppression intersect to shape health and system responses to health. This new edition includes updates on what is currently known about women’s health nationally, as well as internationally, and situates the chapters in the current Canadian health care and policy context. Scholarship is foregrounded in new developments in gender and intersectionality health research and policy in shaping responses to women’s health. Collectively, this volume explores the important histories and contemporary realities in women’s health experiences.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

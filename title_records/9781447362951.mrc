Now seems an appropriate time to think about the contribution schooling makes to the communities it serves and the country generally. However, drawing on his recent research, Richard Riddell argues that the increasingly narrow focus of Education governance after twenty years of reform has made new thinking impossible and has degraded public life. Nevertheless, he highlights new possibilities for democratic behaviour and the opening up of schooling to all it serves.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

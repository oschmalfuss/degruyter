Only when they forgot this aspect of their identity did these nations begin to decline. Recognizing that the United States and China are modern naval powers-rather than seapowers-is essential to understanding current affairs, as well as the long-term trends in world history. This volume is a highly original "big think" analysis of five states whose success-and eventual failure-is a subject of enduring interest, by a scholar at the top of his game.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

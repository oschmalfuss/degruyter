The Ottawa is still a great river, despite the changes made by man, and contributes on a vast scale to the industry, commerce, and amenities of the region. In this book, Robert Legget tells how the river basin was formed geologically in prehistoric times, and how it has been used by explorers, missionaries, fur traders, lumbermen, settlers, travellers, and industry for more than 250 years. He describes the untamed river as the voyageurs saw it, and the major role it played in the fur trade; the heyday of the timber industry when huge rafts of longs were floated downriver to Montreal, and the building of early canals which ushered in the great days of steamboating. Famous pioneer personalities are brought to life, and curious and fascinating incidents are related. He shows how the river has been turned to the use and convenience of man by vast power developments, and also takes the reader on a tour of the river today, indicating the best sites for viewing the scenery and how these may be reached by road, ferry, and rail.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

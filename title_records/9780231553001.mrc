While violence has ebbed and flowed over the years, the threat of terrorism has remained a constant factor, shaping Israeli security policy in a unique way.Boaz Ganor provides an authoritative analysis of Israel’s approach to counterterrorism throughout its existence. Drawing on unprecedented access to Israeli leaders, he offers a comprehensive insider’s account of the decision-making processes, challenges, and dilemmas at the core of counterterror activities. Beginning with infiltration attacks from neighboring states immediately after independence and proceeding through the formation of organized Palestinian terror organizations up to the present day, this book details distinct eras of terrorism and how the Israeli state has counteracted them. Ganor also highlights the dynamic nature of both terrorism and counterterrorism: Just as waves of terror rise, fall, and evolve, so too do the measures employed to respond to them. He distills the lessons of Israel’s experience into key tenets for other countries facing the challenge of terrorism.The book features revelatory personal testimony from senior Israeli decision makers who have played pivotal roles in counterterrorism strategy, including prime ministers, defense ministers, Israeli Defense Forces chiefs of staff, and directors of Mossad and Shin Bet. Israel’s Counterterrorism Strategy is indispensable reading for students, scholars, and practitioners alike.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

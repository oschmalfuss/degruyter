This new edition has been substantially updated to discuss and analyse new topics and issues that have emerged over the last ten years, including: • developments in the way that children and young people’s lives have been theorised and understood; • their engagement in all aspects of contemporary cultures including the spiritual as well as the digital; • the impact of recent political, economic and social change. Drawing on insights from psychology, cultural studies, sociology, anthropology, geography and education, each chapter challenges students’ assumptions and examines crucial issues in the field, such as participation, race, rights, law, transnational childhoods and sexuality. These different perspectives, drawing on different bodies of work, form a holistic picture of the multi-faceted lives of children and young people today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

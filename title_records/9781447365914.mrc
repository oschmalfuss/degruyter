Most were used by more people, for more hours, for more activities. Many households were cut off from normal services and contacts, and many lost the means to pay for their homes. Millions of infections occurred at home, and inequalities in household type, housing space, cost and tenure contributed to the unequal impact of the pandemic. This book brings together a wealth of data, individual testimony and analysis, in one convenient resource for students, scholars and practitioners.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

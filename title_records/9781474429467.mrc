With chapters on landmark films like An Angel at My Table, Heavenly Creatures, Once Were Warriors and Boy, this book explores the influence of the French New Wave and European art cinema, and examines the dialogue between national cinema and a nation’s literature. Looking at the characteristics of an indigenous “Fourth Cinema,” as well as different perspectives on gendered and sexual identities, Coming-of-Age Cinema in New Zealand considers the evidence that these films provide of significant cultural shifts that have taken place or are in the process of taking place as New Zealanders’ discover their emerging national identity.Case studies include:The God Boy (Murray Reece, 1976)Sleeping Dogs (Roger Donaldson, 1977)The Scarecrow (Sam Pillsbury, 1982)Vigil (Vincent Ward, 1984)Mauri (Merata Mita, 1988)An Angel at My Table (Jane Campion, 1990)Heavenly Creatures (Peter Jackson, 1994)Once Were Warriors (Lee Tamahori, 1994)Rain (Christine Jeffs, 2001)Whale Rider (Niki Caro, 2002)In My Father’s Den (Brad McGann, 2004)50 Ways of Saying Fabulous (Stewart Main, 2005)Boy (Taika Waititi, 2010)Mahana (Lee Tamahori, 2016)Hunt for the Wilderpeople (Taika Waititi, 2016)  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

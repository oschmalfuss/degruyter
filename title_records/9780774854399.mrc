That Convention set out a jurisdictional framework for the management of the world's oceans, but it did not provide states with precise guidance on all the issues that can arise. As a state with one of the world's longest coastlines, Canada was one of the principal beneficiaries under the 1982 Convention regime. A study of Canadian policy is particularly significant, as Canadian oceans management places in relief many of the difficult questions yet to be resolved. The central theme of this book, whose multidisciplinary contributors include leading Canadian participants in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, as well as leading Canadian academic and government oceans specialists, concerns the adequacy of the Canadian management responses to a new oceans regime which grants substantial jurisdiction to the coastal state. The chapters look at dispute settlement (maritime boundaries) and examine future Canadian and international policy directions. They are both analytical and prophetic, providing an assessment of the past and presenting a glimpse of the future. Canadian Oceans Policy provides insights into how Canada is managing the oceans and ocean resources off its coast and looks at the problems that lie ahead. The book also makes a major contribution to our understanding of an increasingly vital area of global politics. It will be of interest both to academics and policymakers and to all those concerned with the future of the oceans.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

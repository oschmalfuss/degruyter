Detailing the various forces that have presented prostitution as a social problem, Deborah R. Brock examines anti-prostitution campaigns, urban development, new policing strategies, and the responses of the media, the courts, and governments, as well as feminist, rights, and residents' organizations.Paying particular attention to rights and the means of economic survival within global and local realities, this edition includes new material on recent discourse on sex trafficking, migrant sex work, ex-worker rights organizing, and considers the potential impact of the Robert Pickton trial on the practice of sex work. A comprehensive overview of the crucial debates on prostitution, Making Work, Making Trouble is a welcome addition to twenty-first century sociology and criminology.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

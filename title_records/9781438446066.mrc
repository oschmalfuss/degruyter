In this view, college faculty care only about their research and have little connection to the students sitting passively in front of them. Inside the Undergraduate Teaching Experience directly challenges this view of today's college faculty and serves as a guide for graduate students and new faculty who seek ways—both personal and pedagogical—to become more effective teachers.Inside the Undergraduate Teaching Experience reports the results of the University of Washington's Growth in Faculty Teaching Study (UW GIFTS), which sought to find out whether or not faculty ever change what they do in the classroom, even when there is little external pressure for them to do so. Key findings in the study were that all courses that faculty members taught were deeply embedded in their academic disciplines, even freshman-level classes; that content and critical thinking as goals for learning could not be separated; that faculty members were making changes to their teaching continuously; that such changes were motivated by the faculty member's intentional assessment of the learning needs of her particular classes; and that most changes were aimed at helping students meet faculty members' goals for learning.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

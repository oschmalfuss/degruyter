Glenfell is his first publication in the style of Scottish fiction for which he would become best known; Andrew of Padua, the Improvisatore is a unique synthesis of his experiences with theatre, educational writing, and travel; The Omen is a haunting gothic tale. With their easily readable scope and their vivid themes, each of the tales has a distinct charm. They cast light on significant phases of Galt’s career as a writer and reveal his versatility in experimenting with themes, genres, and styles.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

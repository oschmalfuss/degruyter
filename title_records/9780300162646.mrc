Now newly repackaged, this important book gathers the best of Niebuhr's essays together in a single volume. Selected, edited, and introduced by Robert McAfee Brown-a student and friend of Niebuhr's and himself a distinguished theologian-the works included here testify to the brilliant polemics, incisive analysis, and deep faith that characterized the whole of Niebuhr's life."This fine anthology makes available to a new generation the thought of one of the most penetrating and rewarding of twentieth-century minds. Reinhold Niebuhr remains the great illuminator of the dark conundrums of human nature, history and public policy."-Arthur Schlesinger, Jr."Sparkling gems. . . brought from the shadows of history into contemporary light. Beautifully selected and edited, they show that Niebuhr's fiery polemics and gracious assurances still speak with power to us today."-Roger L. Shinn"An extremely useful volume."-David Brion Davis, New York Review of Books"This collection, which brings together Niebuhr's most penetrating and enduring essays on theology and politics, should demonstrate for a new generation that his best thought transcends the immediate historical setting in which he wrote. . . . [Brown's] introduction succinctly presents the central features of Niebuhr's life and thought."-Library Journal  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

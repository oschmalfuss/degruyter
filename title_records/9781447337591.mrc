Inequality has at last taken centre stage in the political discourse, but there is very little to explain the inequality debates and to offer solutions for the UK. Written by an award-winning academic and policymaker, this introductory book provides a comprehensive survey of all the available evidence, looking at both sides of the inequality argument. Fully up-to-date with the latest developments from the 2017 election and Brexit in the UK to Donald Trump’s election in the USA, this accessible and jargon-free introduction is international in scope and packed with fascinating facts and "es. Roger Brown concludes by discussing whether current UK government policies will actually help reduce inequality and offers practical suggestions for what can be done, such as raising taxes on higher earners, tougher action against tax avoiders, helping people on lower incomes to save, and reducing inequalities in education.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The first half of his survey is chronological, first glancing at the historical background, then describing the gradual development from 1907 to 1929, the depression, war, and post-war eras. The second half is analytical, examining curriculum, enrolment, and employment, graduate studies and research, the University Forest and Ranger School, and undergraduate and Alumni affairs. A number of appendices provide pertinent background data, including a list of Forestry graduates, and there are illustrations of some of the high points in the Faculty's history. Alumni of the Faculty of Forestry will be especially interested in seeing how their Faculty developed, recognizing familiar names and faces, and perhaps reminiscing. It will also be of interest to those concerned with the background of forestry in the Province of Ontario and indeed in Canada as a whole.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

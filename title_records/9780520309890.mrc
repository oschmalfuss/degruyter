A balance between supply and demand must be reached, but it is far from certain that all Californians will get as much water as they want at a price they feel is right. Competition for California Water presents essential information on key issues, including: Costs: What would be the yields and what would be the costs, in dollars as well as less tangible values, of developing new sources of water? Cost-sharing: How much of the cost of water development and distribution should be borne by the general public, and how much by water users and other beneficiaries? Environmental protection: To what extent should environmental values be protected? Conservation: To what extent can the need for new water development be offset by conservation and more efficient use of water? Institutional reform: Can changes in the laws and institutions of California produce a more efficient system of water supply and management? Agriculture: How much increase in cost and/or loss of water can California agriculture bear and still remain competitive? Thirty-one experts on all aspects of this topic project alternative futures for California’s water supply. Written in nontechnical language, Competition for California Water is an invaluable source of information for Californians concerned with the future of their state.This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press’s mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

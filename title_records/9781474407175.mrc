Weaving together literary, linguistic and cognitive analyses of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, illustrations and writings, socio-cultural investigations of the Orient, and rhetorical considerations about Arabian forms of writing, the terms of critical debate surrounding the East are redefined. It takes as a starting point Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978) in order to investigate the latent and manifest traces of the East in Pre-Raphaelite literature and culture. As the book demonstrates, the Pre-Raphaelites and their associates appeared to be the most eligible representatives of a profoundly conservative manifestation of the Orient, of its mystic aura, criminal underworld, and feminine sensuality, or to put it into Arabic terms, of its aja’ib (marvels), mutalibun (treasure-hunters) and hur al-ayn (femmes fatales). Key Features:Looks at how selected examples of Pre-Raphaelite writings acted as major vehicles for raising awareness of cultural diversityRedefines the task of interpreting the East in the late nineteenth century taking as a starting point Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978)By investigating the pervasive influence of The Arabian Nights on Pre-Raphaelite texts, this study aims at bringing together Western and Eastern forms of writingOutlines the reasons why the writings by John Ruskin, D.G. Rossetti, Christina Rossetti, William Morris, Algernon Swinburne, Aubrey Beardsley, and Ford Madox Ford play such a prominent role in the Oriental debate  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Far from being shunted aside, voluntary organizations such as Catholic charities became increasingly entrenched within the expanding welfare state. Standardized reports, state inspections, financial audits, and social work case records, to name only a few, were emblematic of the social scientific impulse that permeated the operations of Catholic charities and enabled them to more systematically police, discipline, and regulate the lives of relief recipients and those designated as moral and social "deviants." Notably, they allowed church authorities and the state to exercise greater control and supervision over the internal operations and procedures of charities, in effect enabling these institutions to govern the daily affairs of the voluntary sector.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

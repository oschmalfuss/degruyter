This book acknowledges the severe problems with effective and significant collective action, but it arrives at a more optimistic diagnosis of our time by rethinking the political from the angle of the experiences with progressive and conservative collective action in different parts of the globe: Brazil, South Africa and Europe. By doing so, it contributes a critical perspective to the debate about the possible impact that the Global South could have for positive social and political developments worldwide.Key FeaturesBased on nuanced historical and comparative analyses of society and politics in three world regions: Latin America, Southern Africa and EuropeParticipates innovatively in the debates in critical political theory about the need to rethink the politicalLinks analytical and normative elements to explain the political as the combination of collective autonomy, problem-oriented reflexivity and a capacity for transformation-oriented interventionFirmly set within the debates in social theory and historical–comparative sociology about varieties of modernity and widens these debates by consciously adopting a world-historical perspective  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

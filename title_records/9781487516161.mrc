These magazines served to embed new instruments of mass communication and socialization within Japanese society and created mechanisms to facilitate the dissemination of hegemonic forms of discourse in Japan in the first half of the twentieth century. The amazing success of Kingu and Ie no hikari during the 1920s and 1930s not only established and normalized participation in a Japanese mass national audience - a community which had previously not existed - but also facilitated the rise of Japanese mass consumer culture in the postwar years. Amy Bliss Marshall argues that the postwar mass Japanese national consumer is foreshadowed by the mass national audience created by family magazines of the interwar era. This book analytically narrates the creation and development of such publications, one explicitly capitalist and one outwardly agrarian, based on missions with an overarching desire to create a mass Japanese magazine audience. Magazines & the Making of Mass Culture in Japan highlights the importance of the seemingly innocuous acts of mass, leisure consumption of magazines and the goods advertised therein, thus aiding our understanding of the creation and direction of a new form of social participation and understanding - an essential part of not only the culture but also the politics of the transwar period.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

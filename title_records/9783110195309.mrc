Until recently, all problems in mathematics, physics and engineering were divided into two classes: well-posed problems and ill-posed problems. The authors introduce a third class of problems: intermediate ones, which are problems that change their property of being well- or ill-posed on equivalent transformations of governing equations, and also problems that display the property of being either well- or ill-posed depending on the type of the functional space used. The book is divided into two parts: Part one deals with general properties of all three classes of mathematical, physical and engineering problems with approaches to solve them; Part two deals with several stable models for solving inverse ill-posed problems, illustrated with numerical examples.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

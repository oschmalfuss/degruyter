The digital divide, whereby rural Canada lags in access to broadband, has created further barriers to participating in the emerging knowledge economy. Revitalizing Rural Economies offers practical tools for developers, business people, and community leaders. The result of a partnership between the Monieson Centre at Queen's School of Business and entrepreneurs, policy makers, economic development officials, and elected representatives from rural communities across southern Ontario, Revitalizing Rural Economies draws on four years of community-based research to provide strategies for economic revitalization. Integrating case studies and community development guidelines, the authors explore themes such as the building blocks for community economic development (CED), innovation, community assets, vibrant downtowns, social capital accumulation through collaboration and inclusion, and new opportunities for rural economies through creative and value-added businesses. Designed as a practical guide, this book serves as a primer to CED, while also allowing those familiar with the field to delve deeper. Case studies ground the discussion in the challenges and opportunities facing communities. The book provides ideas and resources to foster the long-term resilience of rural regions.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

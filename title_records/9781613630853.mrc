Many aspire to reach the C-suite, but the typical paths to the top are hard to find and difficult to follow.In Crack the C-Suite Code, Frangos reveals the hidden dynamics for reaching the C-suite. She offers expert guidance based on her experience as a consultant at Spencer Stuart and former head of global executive talent at Cisco, a company with 70,000 employees. Her deep research on the topic includes candid interviews with CEOs, hundreds of aspiring C-suite candidates, and the leading experts in the field.Frangos identifies four core paths you can follow to reach the C-suite: The Tenured Executive, The Free Agent, The Leapfrog Leader, and The Founder. To actively improve your chances for success, she presents:Insider knowledge from current CEOs and well-known executivesGuiding questions that clarify the risks and rewards associated with each pathAccelerators and derailers that either enhance or detract from your chances to succeedAdvice on how to leverage your experience, leadership brand, and mindset to help you land on the C-suite short listInsight on how the evolving role of the CEO affects your strategy to reach the topA career playbook for anyone who aspires to the top spot, Crack the C-Suite Code features advice from successful C-level leaders, including Accompany's Amy Chang, Goldman Sachs' Edith Cooper, Nest's Yoky Matsuoka, Cisco's Chuck Robbins, and Corning's Wendell Weeks.

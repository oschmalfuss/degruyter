Focusing on the creation and operation of under-examined government institutions and committees devised to exercise subtle control of minority groups, Ivana Caccia explores the shaping of Canadian identity, the introduction of government-inspired citizenship education, and the management of ethnic relations. An engaging work that offers an important account of nation building in Canada and the treatment of ethnic minorities in times of heightened international tensions, Managing the Canadian Mosaic in Wartime provides crucial insights into multicultural policy and the possibility of parallels with the preoccupations with security and surveillance in the aftermath of 9/11.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

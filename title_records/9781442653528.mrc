The schools are viewed as helping students discover jobs matched to their abilities, and policy prescriptions are offered from that standpoint. After examining earlier economic models of education – seeing it in terms of human capital and signalling – the authors analyse their informational model. In the light of the three theories of education, they then proceed to examine the appropriate role of government in the education market, and offer their policy recommendations. In addition, trends in the structure of education over the last two decades are studied and explained from the economic point of view. They argue that too much has been spent on formal education and not enough on on-the-job-training, but the answer is not more government intervention or vocationalism. Education policy should encourage free choice and an increasing ability to match interests or skills with jobs. Vocationalism merely hinders the latter and endangers economic well-being in the long term.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

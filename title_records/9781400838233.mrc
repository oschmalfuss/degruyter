A triumphant follow-up to that acclaimed debut, At Lake Scugog demonstrates why the San Francisco Chronicle has called Troy Jollimore "a new and exciting voice in American poetry." Jollimore is a professional philosopher, and in witty and profound ways his formally playful poems dramatize philosophical subjects--especially the individual's relation to the larger world, and the permeable, constantly shifting border between "inner" and "outer." For instance, the speaker of "The Solipsist," suspecting that the entire world "lives inside of your skull," wonders "why / God would make ear and eye / to face outward, not in." And Tom Thomson--a character who also appeared in Jollimore’s first book--finds himself journeying like an astronaut through the far reaches of the space that fills his head, an experience that prompts him to ask that a doorbell be installed "on the inside," so that he can warn the world before "intruding on’t."______ From At Lake Scugog:LOBSTERS Troy Jollimore ? tend to cluster in prime numbers, sub-oceanic bundles of bug consciousnesssubmerged in waking slumber, plunged in pitsof murk-black water. They have coalesced out of the pitch and grime and salt suspendedwithin that atmospheric gloom. Their skinis colorless below. But when exposedto air, they start to radiate bright green, then, soon, a siren red that wails: I’m dead.The meat inside, though, is as white as teeth,or the hard-boiled egg that comes to mindwhen one cracks that crisp shell and digs beneath. Caress the toothy claw-edge of its pincerand you will know the single, simple thoughtthat populates its mind. The lobster trap is eleganceitself: one moving part: the thing that’s caught.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

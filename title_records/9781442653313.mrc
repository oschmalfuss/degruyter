At the time of his death in 1952 he was Canada's pre-eminent scholar in the field of the social sciences. His reputation was based on his monumental contributions to Canadian economic history and the role of the means of communication in shaping history. As so often happens, his ideas were not greatly followed up, except by Marshall McLuhan, for some years after his death, but there is no growing recognition among Canada's scholars of the depth of his perceptions and the fruitfulness of his thought for understanding of Canada's and of world history. A close friend of Innis at the University of Toronto was Donald G. Creighton, who wrote this memoir of his life in the summer of 1953. To this paperback edition of that work, Professor Creighton has added a new introduction on its origins in the university conditions of its time. A personal tribute, the book is written in Creighton's distinctive and elegant style; it is a skilful biography which will serve well to introduce the career, character, and thought of Harold Adams Innis to a new audience. Donald Creighton himself is recognized as one of the outstanding scholars of his time. Like Innis, he has reinterpreted Canadian history in his many books and this finely crafted memoir reveals the gifts of both the biographer and his subject.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

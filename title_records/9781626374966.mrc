How have these stories, along with adamant members of civil society--those who provide help to travelers in need, as well as those who wish to stop what they see as an invasion of foreigners--shaped public understanding of what happens along the US-Mexico border? And what has this meant for current immigration policy?  Addressing these questions, Cari Eastman explores the relationship among passionate citizen groups in southern Arizona, the messages they promote, and public understanding at the national level of the issues at stake in the immigration debate. Her work encourages thoughtful dialogue, not only about immigration, but also about our own notions of citizenship and belonging.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

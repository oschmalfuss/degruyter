Günderrode's work is an unmined source of insight into German Romanticism and Idealism, as well as into the reception of Indian, Persian, and Islamic thought in Europe. Anna C. Ezekiel's introductions highlight the philosophical significance of the texts, demonstrating their radical and original consideration of the nature of the universe, death, religion, power, and gender roles. The dramas "Hildgund" and "Muhammad, the Prophet of Mecca" are two of Günderrode's most important works for her accounts of agency, recognition, and the status of women. The three poems included in the collection, "Piedro," "The Pilgrims," and "The Kiss in the Dream," represent the wide range of forms in which Günderrode wrote. They reflect themes of erotic longing and union with the divine, and point to her radical reimagining of death. This bilingual English-German edition is the first volume of Günderrode's work to appear in English, and will help unearth this rich, complex, and innovative writer for English readers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

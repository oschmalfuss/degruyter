Since that time, a new endemic genus has been discovered in Maui and many new exotic species have become established. Much more effort also has been expended on the study of Hawaiian birds and their habitats, especially since the passage of the Rare and the Endangered Species Law in 1973.The author traces the known history of the native birds (since Captain Cook’s arrival in 1778) and chronicles the extinction of many species. Each living species is discussed in detail, including its ecology and feeding and breeding behavior. A chapter on exotic species includes the history of their introductions in the Islands and their present distribution, and makes note of the diseases they carried.In addition, annotated appendices cover the 122 species of migrant birds and stragglers, 106 species of introduced or escaped birds not known to have become established, and 22 species of established game birds.This book encompasses all aspects of birdlife in Hawai'i, with emphasis on habits, biological relationships with the environment, and the place of birds in the Hawaiian ecosystems, as well as their prospects for survival.Hawaiian Birdlife is illustrated with 67 color plates and 137 black-and-white figures, including many previously unpublished photographs. The photos were taken by the author and fellow scientists during their many field trips in the Hawaiian Islands, from Hawai'i to Midway Atoll.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

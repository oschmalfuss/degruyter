Daughter, wife, mother, teacher, writer and feminist academic, Helen M. Buss / Margaret Clarke has lived in many parts of Canada and writes from a life of multiple perspectives full of contradictory loyalties and obligations, of opposing histories and identities. For this woman, whose sense of a unified identity is so tenuous that she even writes under two names, writing memoirs becomes the way to bring together the diverse strands of her life. A Newfoundland girl who awakened to the public world just at the moment her homeland joined Canada, she writes of her childhood, of the effects of war, technology, the politics of nation and gender, and of the private world of several generations of her close-knit family. From the perspective of a woman from “away”, she discovers a New Found Land of “girlhood” that weaves past and present in a narrative that delights in questioning its own making.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

With a succinct account of Bellour’s oeuvre, this book provides a generous introduction to his ideas on cinema, an annotated bibliography of his work, and a six-chapter translation of a substantial and wide-ranging interview previously unavailable in English. Providing a clear, systematic account of the evolution of Bellour’s thought on the nature of cinematic representation, the impact of digital technology and the response of the spectator, this is an essential guide to the work of a major contemporary thinker.Key featuresProvides a clear, systematic exposition of the evolution of Bellour’s thought over 60 yearsMakes available in an English translation a hitherto unpublished interview with Bellour from 2015Includes an annotated bibliography, with brief abstracts of all of his books and most important articles  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

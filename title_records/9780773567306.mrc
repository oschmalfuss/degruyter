He examines the social background of students and the competing goals of parents, teachers, and governments. He criticizes progressivism, or child-centred education, and speaks out against the closed-mindedness of the educational establishment. He also looks at current research on effective and ineffective schools, as well as on education achievement in national and international terms. His findings show that the difficulties facing Canadian schools are not caused by a lack of money but by a poor allocation of funds. Increasingly frustrated parents, dedicated teachers, and discouraged professors will find The Reformation of Canada's Schools a welcome source of ideas, information, and thought-provoking possibilities for combating the crisis in Canadian education.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

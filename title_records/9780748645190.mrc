Can reflective practice be refocused by asking teachers to place classroom interaction and discourse at the centre of their reflections?In this accessible textbook, Steve Walsh explains why it is essential to put an understanding of classroom discourse at the centre of any second language teacher education programme, whether it is a formal programme under the guidance of a teacher educator or a more informal, self-directed programme of teacher development. He argues that in order to improve their professional practice, language teachers need to gain a detailed, up-close understanding of their local context by focusing on the complex relationship between teacher language, classroom interaction and learning. In order to do this he revisits and reconceptualises the notion of reflective practice by giving teachers appropriate tools which allow them to reflect on and improve their professional practice.This thought-provoking book not only stimulates debate on classroom discourse and reflective practice, but also contains practical exercises and advice which will be invaluable to both new and experienced language teachers as well as to researchers in applied linguistics.Task commentaries, a glossary of technical terms and an annotated list of further reading are also included.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Sa’di, a prominent ethicist and a devout teacher of virtues, stands out for his worldliness, his practical teachings, and his love for living a wholesome life, as well as for his signature elegance and artistry that has compelled critics to call his lyrics perfectly polished diamonds.In a language deliberately free of technical jargon, Keshavarz argues for the versatility of Sa‘di’s poetic voice and portrays his notion of love as open to multiple perspectives including homoerotic aesthetics. She brings to life the worldly wisdom that kept the lyrical, adventurous, and ethical legacy of Sa’di fresh and effective through the passage of time. Key FeaturesIncludes hundreds of verses in translation, making it ideal for use by studentsExplores the connections between poetry and lived experienceHighlights the role of classical Persian poetry as the 'silk road of the imagination', connecting many polities and diverse ways of lifeExamines the poetic strategies that give Sa’di’s substantive and sumptuous lyrics their unique status  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

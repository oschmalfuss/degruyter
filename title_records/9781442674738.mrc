Manitoulin's scenic natural delights and long, fascinating history attract thousands of visitors annually from around the world.Shelley Pearen's family settled on the island in 1864. For nearly three decades she has been gathering information about its history and lore. First published in 1992, Exploring Manitoulin is intended for both the island-born "Haweater" (it is believed early pioneers were once saved from starvation by eating the berries of the hawthorn tree) who wants learn more and the visitor who wants to discover the real Manitoulin. The book is organized around five automobile tours of the island, with a sixth section describing the approach to the island from the north. Along each route, Pearen writes about the history of the settlements, the people who lived and worked there, and the land around them.The third edition of Exploring Manitoulin has been completely updated to include two new provincial parks created on the island in the last decade, new hiking trails, museums, and attractions, and a number of unique activities and events often missed by visitors. Two entirely new chapters have been added as well, outlining the history of touring and tourism on Manitoulin and describing the pow wow as an introduction to native culture. Designed to be read before, during, and after touring, as well as by the armchair traveller, this is a book for anyone interested in Manitoulin Island's past, present, and future.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

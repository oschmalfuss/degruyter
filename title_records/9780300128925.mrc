CIA speechwriter and analyst Charles E. Lathrop has compiled and annotated more than 3,000 "ations from such disparate sources as the Bible, spy novels and movies, Shakespeare’s plays, declassified CIA documents, memoirs, TV talk shows, and speeches from U.S. and foreign leaders and officials.Arranged in thematic categories with opening commentary for each section, the "ations speak for themselves. Together they serve both to illuminate a world famous for its secrets and deceptions and to show the extent to which intelligence has manifested itself in literature and in life. Engaging, informative, and often irreverent, The Literary Spy is an exceedingly satisfying book-one that meets the needs of the serious researcher just as ably as those of the armchair spy in pursuit of an evening’s entertainment.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Corwin (1878–1963), universally acknowledged to be the most important commentator on the U.S. Constitution in the twentieth century, died before he could write the single definitive work he had planned. Richard Loss has devoted himself to the task of editing a three-volume collection (of which this is the second) of Corwin's major essays on the Constitution. The seventeen essays in Volume II focus on Article III (the judicial article) of the Constitution. They were, in Corwin's judgment, among his most important works. Thus this volume is a sequel both to Volume I, which treated Articles I and II of the Constitution, and to Presidential Power and the Constitution, in which Loss gathered most of Corwin's essays on the presidency.The editor has organized the essays under the headings "The Origins of Judicial Review," "The Development of Judicial Supremacy," "The Exercise of Judicial Review," and "Appraisals of Judicial Review." Each essay is reprinted in its entirety, including footnotes.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

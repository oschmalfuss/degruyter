This book proposes a taxonomy of the main themes and concerns of this political thought under the three ideals of the rule of law, limited government and legitimate delegation of power. Further, it recommends a contextualist approach for interpreting Islamic political texts based on their narrow social, intellectual and political contexts. Examining treatises by 5 carefully selected authors who flourished in the Syro-Egyptian lands in the period between c.1250 and c.1350, the book also deals with important questions of authorship, readership and dedicatees, authorial motives and intentions, genres and literary styles, sources and influences, and applicability.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

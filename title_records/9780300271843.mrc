She considers how, as revolutionary things traveled from one site in the Atlantic to another, they brought people into contact with these political movements in visceral, multiple, and provocative ways. Focusing on a wide range of objects with transnational reach—ceramics and furniture, garments and accessories, prints, maps, and public amusements—she draws out the political impact of material culture for diverse populations. Enslaved and free, women and men, poor, middling, and elite—all turned to objects as a means to realize their varied, and sometimes competing, visions of revolutionary change.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

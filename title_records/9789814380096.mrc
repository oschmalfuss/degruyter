The British colonial system is relevant in so far as it had imprinted certain habits of thought upon those who had experienced it, and had created a self-perpetuating momentum which, try as they might, the Japanese could not entirely reverse. Nevertheless, for some young people of the island, school became the point of intellectual contact with the ideology of their new ulers, the 'pivotal institution' for a novel process of cultural indoctrination. The purpose of this paper is to consider Japanese educational policy, the factor militating against its full implementation, and the extent to which the system that emerged served as an agent for change.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 22.

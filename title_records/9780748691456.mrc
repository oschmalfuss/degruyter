And how is clerical authority shaped across borders? Based on a political sociology of two families of religious scholars, al-Hakim and al-Khu’i, Elvire Corboz explains the internal workings of transnational leadership patterns in Shi`ism for the first time.Corboz compares the multifaceted roles played by Shi`i clerics in contemporary affairs with selective narratives about the traditional system of religious authority (the marja`iyya), political organisations, and international charities. Whether informal or institutionalised, their authority networks are in constant negotiation between communities and states in Iraq, Iran, other Middle Eastern countries, the Indian sub-continent South-East Asia, and the West. This multi-sited approach clarifies the local and transnational dynamics that underpin clerical authority.Key FeaturesAnalyses the networking, philanthropic and political practices of Shi`i clerical figures across borders from a sociological perspective to enhance our understanding of Muslim authorityIncludes case studies of two prominent families of religious scholars, which explain the continued relevance of Shi‘i clerics to Muslim politics and societyEngages in the topical debate on transnational Shi`ism by exploring the cross-border religious networks in and beyond the Middle East"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

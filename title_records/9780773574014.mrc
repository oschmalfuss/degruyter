The varied lives of medieval women, their power and status within society, are depicted through their own writings; questions of medieval culture are linked to those facing humanity in our time; travel, as experienced by the most prestigious ambassador and by the lowliest pilgrim, is explored; and the origins and conditions of health care are examined. These themes have inspired or informed the author's eight major historical works, but are revisited here with the clarity, wit and discipline of a great teacher. A Medieval Miscellany will give readers already acquainted with Labarge's work new pleasure, and provide an enticing path into medieval lives and time for new readers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

He does so in a personable style – often peppered with wry real-life reflections on the day-to-day practice of this multifarious and politically volatile area of legal and social life in Scotland.The book contextualises the history and policy of the 2005 Act and its legion amendments, providing detailed analysis of post-2009 case law cross-referenced with significant legacy decisions, such as in relation to the fit and proper test or the proper purpose of the licensing function. It explores and deconstructs fundamental concepts such as licensing objectives, overprovision, causality, the licensing 'nexus' and the very nature of a Licensing Board.McGowan also delivers practical advice on the pitfalls and perils of application basics including how to complete (and assess) a premises licence application, as well as valuable insight from the front lines and conduct at hearings. There is no better guide to how Scottish alcohol licensing law works – and often does not work – in practice.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

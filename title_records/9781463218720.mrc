Succinct and irenic, this treatment will be appreciated by Christians who are still concerned over the implications that serious biblical study raises.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 10.

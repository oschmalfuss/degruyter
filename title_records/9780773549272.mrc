And how did these decisions shape the army’s operations on the ground? In Whose Mission, Whose Orders?, David Charters pulls back the curtain on secret debates between British politicians and generals, as each struggled to assert their control over army operations. Consulting original sources, Charters examines the roles played by politicians, generals, and senior civil servants in the initial deployment of troops in 1969, the internment operation, the removal of the “no-go” areas, and the Ulster Workers' Council general strike. The case studies highlight the army’s dualistic character as both a professional force and a skilled political player. Despite its political function, Charters argues, politicians did not always listen to the army’s military advice, leading to unsound decisions that aggravated and prolonged the unrest. Illustrating the complex and dynamic balance of civil and military objectives that informed security policy and operations during the conflict in Northern Ireland, Whose Mission, Whose Orders? offers new perspectives on command and control in unconventional warfare.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

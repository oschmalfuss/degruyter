While remaining unaffiliated with any particular faction, Dr. Farrell sees changes in the industry: an increased emphasis on quality, greater public involvement in industry decision making, better public and industry awareness, and a marked reorientation from domestic to international tourism. But he also warns of the dire results of moving in certain undesirable directions.What occurred in Hawaii provides a model for other places, especially developing countries. It illustrates both domestic and international tourism, benefits and costs, amity and frustration, interaction of hosts and guests, and, if not the way certain problems may be avoided, those problems which should not be allowed to develop.This book will be important for concerned residents of Hawaii, inveterate travelers or investors, the curious who wish to go beyond the travel poster, politicians who want to make the best decisions, activists who wish to see how the industry really operates, busy tourism industry managers who wish to widen their vistas, students of tourism, and the residents of developing countries who can then better decide whether tourism is the direction in which they want their countries to go.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

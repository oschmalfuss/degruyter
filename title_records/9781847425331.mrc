As advocacy moves into the mainstream of health and social care provision, and the prospect of a legal right to advocacy inches closer, so the need to scrutinise key values and practices in advocacy becomes urgent. Although advocacy is widely acclaimed as a 'good thing', there is little agreement as to how it should be implemented, funded or evaluated. A right result?: reviews the range of third party advocacy provision and practice in the UK; addresses key issues facing the contemporary advocacy movement, such as the need for independence, developing quality standards and security of funding; suggests viable ways forward; moves beyond the partisan tendency to champion one kind of advocacy to offer an inclusive account of different styles. Through this inclusive approach, the book offers the first comprehensive analysis of the benefits of advocacy. A right result? is required reading for anyone with an interest in advocacy and the rights of disempowered people, particularly individuals and agencies with a stake in the promotion and development of advocacy services and schemes in the UK.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

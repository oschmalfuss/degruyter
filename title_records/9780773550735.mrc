In this fascinating look at the philosophy of self-esteem, Richard Keshen develops and defends the idea of reasonable self-esteem -- a concept based on an ideal of reasonableness -- and argues that individuals who think of themselves in terms of this paradigm will lead happier and more fulfilling lives. Keshen presents a set of guidelines for analysing self-esteem and examines various factors that influence our self-esteem, such as other people's evaluations, comparisons with others, social relationships, and inherent qualities. He asserts that self-esteem not founded on individual achievement leads to a continual search for external supports and is easily shaken when such supports are not found. A key element of Keshen's argument is the ideal of egalitarian respect, and he shows how we can integrate this ideal into our lives. Reasonable Self-Esteem demonstrates the attraction of a life in which reasonableness is a central commitment. It will appeal to those with an interest in philosophy, ethics, and moral psychology and is essential reading for those concerned with self-esteem.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

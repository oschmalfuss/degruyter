Tseen-Ling Khoo shows that Asian-Canadian and Asian-Australian literatures are developing in dissimilar ways because of demographic and geographical differences, the degree of governmental intervention through cultural policy initiatives, and the levels of encouragement or financial support for racial minority authors and their work. Khoo exposes the particularities of literary development within specific historical bases through comparative critiques of Asian-Canadian and Asian-Australian texts and argues that the questions of whether authors of Asian descent writing in the western world are adding to national canons or creating subversive (but marginalized) streams will remain as long as binary demarcations prevail. Khoo contends that literary criticism should see racial minority literatures as existing in both categories at once, thus shifting the boundaries of what constitutes a national canon as well as posing challenges to the literary status quo.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

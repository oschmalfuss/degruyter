The book's unique two-part organization helps both first-time and experienced nurses through the job application process, the interviewing process, job training, and everything in between! In Part I you will learn the ins and outs of the interviewing process: how to get your application noticed, how to prepare for the interview, how to uncover hints in an interviewer’s question, and more. Part II is an extensive review of what you need to know in order to ensure success in your interview. This section includes an overview of fundamental medications and techniques, providing a quick review for those about to go into an interview, and for those considering nursing as a profession, it is a great resource to know what you will need to learn. Cracking the Nursing Interview also provides practice interview questions and solutions, so readers can go into their interviews confidently. In addition to interview tips and tricks, readers will learn how to sell their value and determine if they fit within a specific healthcare organization. Nurses will be given an overview of the unique nurse hiring process, a detailed walk-through of the various nursing careers available to them, and all the information necessary to identify and pursue their ideal career. With a dual career in nursing and information technology, Jim Keogh, DNP, RN-BC is a nurse educator at New Jersey’s largest hospital as well as an assistant professor at New York University and a faculty member at Saint Peter’s University in Jersey City, New Jersey, as well as a former faculty member and chair of the e-commerce track of study at Columbia University.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 25.

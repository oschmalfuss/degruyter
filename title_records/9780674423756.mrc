Using his observation of 1,000 children brought to the Stanford University Pediatric-Psychiatric Unit as a guide, Dr. Shirley illustrates his discussion of physical, mental, and emotional disturbances with case histories, thus presenting the relationships between physician and parent, and physician and child in dynamic form, and stressing the individual nature of each case. Yet, despite the unique character of each behavior problem, there are common denominators in childhood development. Dr. Shirley sets forth the generally accepted norms of physical and mental growth and evaluates the usefulness of psychometric procedures, such as intelligence and performance tests, in determining the limits of the child's intellectual and physical capacities. Grade placement, discipline, eating and sleeping are universal trouble spots. Dr. Shirley suggests specific leads for the pediatrician to follow in the treatment of these problems, cautioning that success depends upon relieving parents of anxiety concerning themselves and their children in order that an atmosphere conducive to cooperation may exist in the home. Dr. Shirley's experience and training in both pediatrics and psychiatry doubly qualify him to discuss the basic elements of child psychiatry with authority and insight. Parents as well as physicians can profit by Dr. Shirley's wise, articulate, and practical interpretation of psychological concepts as they relate to the prevention and treatment of behavior problems in children.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

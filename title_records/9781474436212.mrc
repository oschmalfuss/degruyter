It brings together a selection of original, research-led essays on more than a dozen avant-garde British writers of the 1960s, revealing this to be a crucial – and crucially overlooked – period of British literary history.Via detailed readings of authors such as Ann Quin, B.S. Johnson, Alexander Trocchi, Maureen Duffy, Alan Burns, Christine Brooke-Rose and many others, the contributors reveal the diversity of material produced in this period and trace the complex relations of influence and indebtedness between the 60s avant-garde, earlier modernisms and later postmodern writing. The volume shows that the 1960s is an even more vibrant period of literary experiment in Britain than might previously have been supposed – and that the avant-garde fiction produced then rewards our renewed attention to it.Key Features:Provides much-needed critical analyses of the work of 60s avant-garde writers Offers focused essays – each presents one author in their cultural/critical/historical contexts – by experts in the fieldRecuperates a lost decade in British literature and thus fills a vital gap in literary history, between late modernism and early postmodernismResponds to burgeoning critical and popular interest in authors such as Christine Brooke-Rose, Ann Quin, and B.S. Johnson, and to a widespread interest in experimental and innovative writing more generally  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

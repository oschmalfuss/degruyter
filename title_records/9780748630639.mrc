In this book Charles Warren tackles the hottest current debates - land reform, the future of farming, public access, conservation of moorland and birds of prey, the place of forestry, and the control of alien species and red deer - and takes up the challenge of integrating conservation with social and economic objectives. The second edition includes a new chapter on energy and the environment, taking in the highest profile environmental issue in Scotland at present: the windfarm controversy, and debates about the appropriate energy mix for the future. There is also a heightened focus throughout on climate change and its implications for the management of Scotland's environment. In addition, the book has been updated throughout to take account of recent changes in environmental and related social and political issues.Key Featuresintegrated, up-to-date and in-depth treatment of all the main debates about the Scottish environmentexamines the ethical issues behind environmental decision-makingaccessibly written for the non-specialistbalanced, even-handed treatment of the issues"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Its intention is to kick-start a fresh debate about the moral foundations of social policy and welfare reform. The ethics of welfare: explores the concepts of dependency, responsibility and rights and their significance for social citizenship; draws together findings from a range of recent research that has investigated popular, political, welfare provider and welfare user discourses; discusses, in a UK context, the relevance of the recent Human Rights Act for social policy; presents arguments in favour of a human rights based approach to social welfare. The book is essential reading for anyone concerned about the future of welfare. It is aimed at students and academics in social policy, social work, sociology, politics and law. It will also interest policy makers and welfare professionals, particularly those concerned with welfare benefits and social care.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

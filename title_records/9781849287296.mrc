The Internet has become the defining medium for information exchange in the modern world, and the unprecedented success of new web publishing platforms such as those associated with social media has confirmed its dominance as the main information exchange platform for the foreseeable future. But how do you conduct an online investigation when so much of the Internet isn’t even indexed by search engines? Accessing and using the information that’s freely available online is about more than just relying on the first page of Google results. Open source intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence gathered from publically available sources, and is the key to unlocking this domain for the purposes of investigation. Product overview The Tao of Open Source Cyber Intelligence provides a comprehensive guide to OSINT techniques, for the investigator: It catalogues and explains the tools and investigative approaches that are required when conducting research within the surface, deep and dark webs. It explains how to scrutinise criminal activity without compromising your anonymity – and your investigation. It examines the relevance of cyber geography and how to get round its limitations It describes useful add-ons for common search engines, as well as considering Metasearch engines (including Dogpile, Zuula, PolyMeta, iSeek, Cluuz, and Carrot2) that collate search data from single-source intelligence platforms such as Google. It considers deep web social media platforms and platform-specific search tools, detailing such concepts as concept mapping, Entity Extraction tools, and specialist search syntax (Google Kung-Fu). It gives comprehensive guidance on Internet security for the smart investigator, and how to strike a balance between security, ease of use and functionality, giving tips on counterintelligence, safe practices, and debunking myths about online privacy. OSINT is a rapidly evolving approach to intelligence collection, and its wide application makes it a useful methodology for numerous practices, including within the criminal investigative community. The Tao of Open Source Cyber Intelligence is your guide to the cutting edge of this information collection capability. About the author Stewart K. Bertram is a career intelligence analyst who has spent over a decade working across the fields of counterterrorism, cyber security, corporate investigations and geopolitical analysis. The holder of a Master’s degree in Computing and a Master of Letters in Terrorism studies, Stewart is uniquely placed at the cutting edge of intelligence and investigation, where technology and established tradecraft combine. Stewart fuses his academic knowledge with significant professional experience, having used open source intelligence on such diverse real-world topics as the terrorist use of social media in Sub-Saharan Africa and threat assessment at the London Olympic Games. Stewart teaches courses on open source intelligence as well as practising what he preaches in his role as a cyber threat intelligence manager for some of the world’s leading private-sector intelligence and security agencies.    aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

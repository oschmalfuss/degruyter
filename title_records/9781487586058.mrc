First issued in 1947, steady demand has caused it to be frequently reprinted, and it is now reissued in a new, much enlarged edition.Anyone who has the job of providing attrative, nourishing meals to large numbers of people, will find this book useful; it will be invaluable to those without long professional experience. Every recipe in the book is the product of prolonged testing, and the quantities specified for preparing servings of 100-125 portions may be relied on. In addition, the recipes are set out with great clarity, and directions are simple and easy to follow. Quantities for each ingredient are given by both weight and bulk measures. In addition to many wholly new recipes, the revised edition includes a number of alternative richer and more elaborate versions of popular recipes, thus widening the usefulness of the book. A new section on frozen foods has been included, along with suggestions for using other prepared foods developed in recent years. In designing the new edition, every effort has been made to make it even more easy to read than before, for example, bold type has been used for ingredients. The binding is durable cloth boards, which will open flat. Attractive line drawings at section openings introduce a touch of humour into the business of feeding a crowd.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

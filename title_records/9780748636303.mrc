But unlike other books on practice-led research, it balances this with discussion of how research can impact positively on creative practice through research-led practice. The editors posit an iterative and web-like relationship between practice and research. Essays within the book cover a wide range of disciplines including creative writing, dance, music, theatre, film and new media, and the contributors are from the UK, US, Canada and Australia. The subject is approached from numerous angles: the authors discuss methodologies of practice-led research and research-led practice, their own creative work as a form of research, research training for creative practitioners, and the politics and histories of practice-led research and research-led practice within the university. The book will be invaluable for creative practitioners, researchers, students in the creative arts and university leaders.Key FeaturesThe first book to document, conceptualise and analyse practice-led research in the creative arts and to balance it with research-led practiceWritten by highly qualified academics and practitioners across the creative arts and sciencesBrings together empirical, cultural and creative approachesPresents illuminating case histories of creative work and practice-led researchMore information about Hazel SmithMore information about Roger T.

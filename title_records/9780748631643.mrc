Bush to the presidency, as a critical factor in explaining the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Key FeaturesProvides a comprehensive analysis of US-Iraqi relations from 1979Demonstrates that the second Iraq War is a result of a longer historical process and not just the product of 9/11 and the War on TerrorDeepens understanding of the underlying factors of US policy towards the Persian Gulf, and its oilUses World Systems Theory to analyse US foreign policy"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

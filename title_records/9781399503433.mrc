In this fully annotated modern version, Timothy J. Shannon re-acquaints modern readers with this popular North American captivity narrative, featuring a Scottish protagonist. He tells the story of Peter Williamson, a native of Aberdeen, who claimed he was kidnapped into indentured servitude in North America, lived as a captive among Indians there, and then fought as a soldier in the Seven Years’ War until he was taken prisoner by the French. After returning to Britain, Williamson peddled his tale while dressed in Indian costume, and he eventually settled in Edinburgh, where he became known as 'Indian Peter'.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

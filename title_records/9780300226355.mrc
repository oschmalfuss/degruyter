Examining firsthand accounts of the crises and scrutinizing the prevailing weather patterns during the 1640s and 1650s-longer and harsher winters, and cooler and wetter summers-Parker reveals evidence of disrupted growing seasons causing malnutrition, disease, a higher death toll, and fewer births.   This new abridged edition distills the original book's prodigious research for a broader audience while retaining and indeed emphasizing Parker's extraordinary historical achievement: his dazzling demonstration of the link between climate change and worldwide catastrophe 350 years ago. Yet, the contemporary implications of his study are equally important: are we prepared today for the catastrophes that climate change could bring tomorrow? At half the original length, this user-friendly abridgment is ideal for students and general readers seeking a rapid handle on the key issues.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

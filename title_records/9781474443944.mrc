Alexandra Hyde explores the mobile and contradictory position of civilian women as they navigate British Army culture and its reified production of social belonging. The book considers wives’ exposure to – and implication in – processes of militarisation and, ultimately, war and state-sanctioned violence as they ‘live with’ rather than ‘serve in’ the military.Chapters explore multiple circuits of mobility and migration; women’s productive and reproductive labour; rank and its relationship to class and ethnicity; and women’s pre-emptive management of grief and human vulnerability. What emerges is a critical, feminist exploration of the composite relations of gender, class, sexuality and nation that combine to make and remake military power.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

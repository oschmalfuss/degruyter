Increased availability of Persian chronicles, emergence of a class of professional historians and progressive forces emanating from the anti-colonial movement have led to new approaches to the period.Situating Medieval India covers more than 6 centuries, from the Delhi Sultanate to the arrival of Europeans. Topics covered include approaches to exercise of sovereign power in medieval states and the social identity of government officers, Dulla Bhatti's revolt against the Mughal State, modes of resistance in the state of Punjab, and religious diversity in Agra. The author also examines scientific and technical innovations, and the artworks of Mushtaqi, Jahangir and Bhandari. The book opens up medieval India in all its complexity and richness.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

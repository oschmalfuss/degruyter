This book explores the settlement and development of Muslim communities in Scotland, highlighting the ongoing changes in their structure and the move towards a Scottish experience of being Muslim. This experience combines a sense of civic and social belonging to Scotland with a strong religious and ideological commitment to Islam.Find out moreRead Stefano Bonino's post 'Scottish Muslims: Unity and Belonging' on the Edinburgh University Press blogWatch: Scottish Muslims in NumbersRead an interview with Stefano Bonino in La RazonRead an article by Stefano published on GeopoliticaRead the Muslims in Scotland press release"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

Foss (1899-1953) is best known for his work as founder and first music editor for Oxford University Press. Foss promoted composers in England between the World Wars, most notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton, Constant Lambert, and Peter Warlock. The first part of this book is based on the memoirs of his wife Dora, who was herself a professional singer. The book - through the presentation of memoirs and letters - recreates a vivid picture of the musical world during the inter-war period when there was a renaissance of English music. Foss's work for OUP saw the music department expand from publishing a limited number of sheet music items to a comprehensive inventory of operas, orchestral compositions, chamber and vocal works, and piano pieces. Foss also greatly expanded the press's publication of books on music, music analysis, and music appreciation. Leaving OUP's music department in1941, Foss pursued a number of freelance musical occupations, serving as critic, reviewer, journalist, author and frequent broadcaster. The book includes letters sent to and received from such luminaries as Hamilton Harty,Constant Lambert, Edith Sitwell, Donald Tovey, Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton, Henry J. Wood, Arthur Bliss, Benjamin Britten, Roger Quilter, Percy Scholes, Leopold Stokowski, Michael Tippett, Thomas Hardy, James Joyce andWalter de la Mare. Many of the letters presented here have never been published before. An authoritative introduction by Simon Wright (Head of Rights & Contracts, Music, OUP) provides a detailed overview of Hubert Foss and his place in music publishing. STEPHEN LLOYD is the author of William Walton: Muse of Fire and Constant Lambert: Beyond the Rio Grande (both published by Boydell). DIANA SPARKES is the daughter of Hubert and Dora Foss. BRIAN SPARKES is her husband and an Emeritus Professor of Classical Archaeology.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

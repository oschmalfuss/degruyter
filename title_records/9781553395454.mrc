Despite his relative inexperience, Clark rose quickly in federal politics, gaining a seat in the House of Commons in the 1972 election and winning the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party only four years later. This volume collects a number of significant speeches from Joe Clark's illustrious career in Parliament. It captures over forty years of his public service from when he was a rookie member of Parliament, to his time as the prime minister, a cabinet minister, and the senior statesman of the House of Commons. His speeches are arranged in thematic areas such as parliamentary accountability, foreign affairs, constitutional debates, and the economy. Insightful and wide-ranging, A Man of Parliament demonstrates that Joe Clark's influence on Parliament continues to shape contemporary policy debates.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

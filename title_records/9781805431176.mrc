This rare survival shines a light upon the craft and fraternity of Brewers of London at a time of change, when ale production faced competition from beer brewers. The clerk declared his intention to use English, as King Henry V did in letters from France, rather than Latin and French, which gives the book a linguistic significance. By 1418, the company had its own hall, in St Mary Aldermanbury parish. The clerk recorded entries to the freedom and the fraternity, annual payments, the men and women who bought livery cloth, and preparations for the annual feast. In 1423 the Brewers created an almshouse for their poor members and listed the building works and costs involved. The Brewers faced criticism and hostility from mayor Richard Whittington, which are documented vividly. The Brewers supplied ale to the household of Queen Katherine and for her coronation. The clerk wrote an account of the funeral processions for King Henry V in 1422 in London and Westminster, noting the role played by the London crafts.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

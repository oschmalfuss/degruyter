The lectures (now essays) convey a highly original, and personal, view of that development, and like the personality who set them down they are sharp, opinionated, and as pungent as cheddar."-The New Republic "Gilmore offers us, in readily digestible form, the benefits of a lifetime of legal scholarship, with an insight here, a hypothesis there, and balanced judgment throughout. ... [This book is] an exciting and lively little intellectual history of American law. Blessed with a clean and lean style, Gilmore condenses the sweep of centuries, putting movements and individual heroes into perspective."-New York Law Journal"Grant Gilmore's newest book is a joy to read. It is written in a beautiful style, it is intellectually challenging, and it relates the fascinating story of the history of American law.... [It] is a classic and will be read in the next twenty years both in the law schools and in the universities."-Perspective"Gilmore's penchant for the idiosyncratic and his willingness to challenge widely held generalizations give this book a special character. Throughout, the book is lucidly written and possesses a disarming combination of wit and erudition. The Ages of American Law is a notable addition to the legal literature spawned by the Storrs Foundation."-American Historical ReviewGrant Gilmore is Sterling Professor Emeritus of Law at Yale Law School.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

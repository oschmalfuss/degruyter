To see Walt Whitman co-producing foreign editions of his work with British poets while exuberantly breaking free from verse strictures on the page, or to witness Margaret Fuller reporting from the battle ground in revolutionary Rome as well as writing her country’s first feminist treatise is to comprehend more deeply the ways in which these writers acted in the transatlantic sphere. By practicing Atlantic citizenship, they were able to achieve critical distance from the United States and, paradoxically, to catalyse its ongoing growth.Key FeaturesQuestions the American" identity of representative authors, even as they test the moral and geographical limits of American nationalityDemonstrates the political and commercial power of transatlantic networkingIlluminates literature’s dependence upon other modes of professional creativityExamines archival documents alongside familiar literary works"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

The protection of information and associated assets – information security – is therefore overtaking physical asset protection as a fundamental corporate governance responsibility.  Information security management system requirements ISO 27000, which provides an overview for the family of international standards for information security, states that “An organisation needs to undertake the following steps in establishing, monitoring, maintaining and improving its ISMS […] assess information security risks and treat information security risks”. The requirements for an ISMS are specified in ISO 27001. Under this standard, a risk assessment must be carried out to inform the selection of security controls, making risk assessment the core competence of information security management and a critical corporate discipline. Plan and carry out a risk assessment to protect your information Information Security Risk Management for ISO 27001 / ISO 27002: Provides information security and risk management teams with detailed, practical guidance on how to develop and implement a risk assessment in line with the requirements of ISO 27001. Draws on national and international best practice around risk assessment, including BS 7799-3:2017 (BS 7799-3). Covers key topics such as risk assessment methodologies, risk management objectives, information security policy and scoping, threats and vulnerabilities, risk treatment and selection of controls. Includes advice on choosing risk assessment software. Ideal for risk managers, information security managers, lead implementers, compliance managers and consultants, as well as providing useful background material for auditors, this book will enable readers to develop an ISO 27001-compliant risk assessment framework for their organisation and deliver real, bottom-line business benefits.

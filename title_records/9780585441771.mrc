It examines environmental issues from many points of view - from the iconic landscapes that are part of the Scottish sense of identity to actual policies formulated by the newly devolved political establishment. The juxtaposition of cultural attitudes and national policies offers a fascinating contrast between the landscape in imagination and in practical policy.Anna Paterson explores the differences between rhetoric and practice, and considers approaches and attitudes to urban and rural development in contemporary Scottish writing. Attention is then focused upon tourism and stewardship of the land, city planning and rural building, small businesses, local authorities, voluntary organisations - seen as forming a network of individuals trying to match their cultural assumptions to economic practicalities.The author asks tough questions about controversial issues. Are the National Park designations a ticket to ride for commercial tourist developments? Should Scotland's forests be used for recreation or timber production? Are cities suffering more from zoning or from poor design? Is there a contradiction between healthy countryside sports and modern sport management? Finally, she asks what might make sustainable development work in Scotland.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

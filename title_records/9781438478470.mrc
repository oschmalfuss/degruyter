Hayward's Transforming Higher Education in Asia and Africa analyzes change processes in higher education in eight Asian and African countries. The twelve cases range from the push to upgrade and transform higher education in Afghanistan in the midst of a war, to the successful struggle against apartheid in South African institutions, as well as thwarted efforts in Sierra Leone and Madagascar. Providing both practical lessons learned and hope for communities globally, Hayward demonstrates that higher education change and even transformation, which is more fundamental and structural, can occur even in the most difficult environments. Successful transformation requires well-crafted strategic and budget plans with careful implementation, monitoring, and effective leadership at multiple levels. Yet also critical are a commitment to human development, a desire for freedom and belief in democracy, and recognition that high-quality higher education is essential to national development.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

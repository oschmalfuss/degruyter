Three educators from three different disciplines write on issues not usually forefronted in curriculum studies: boundaries, disgrace, distance, fear, forgiveness, light, and mothers. Their gendered voices give new meaning to the idea of curriculum to include that which courses through their lives in the classroom, in the public sphere, and in their nighttime personas. Each writer demonstrates to what extent teaching must interact with living in the twenty-first century.Writing from the perspectives of medicine, elementary education, and literature, the authors examine what it is like to live and work in a multidisciplined, multilayered world. Their chapters, born out of their life experiences, critique the serious issues of our time—terrorism, technology, power, and privilege—hoping to stimulate readers to think about their own public and private selves.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

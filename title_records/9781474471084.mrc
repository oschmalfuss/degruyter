Combining theory with empirical research, he engages with the ideas of key thinkers - such as Giddens, Goffman, Hall and Williams - whilst also referring to detailed ethnographic and historical data. Specific topics discussed by the author include the domestic consumption of broadcasting, the formation of imagined communities and the presentation of self in mediated encounters.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The book adopts three underlying principles to offer an accessible and highly practical resource for beginning and novice teachers.Firstly, it is strongly evidence-based, and mediates the relevant international research so that it becomes useful for beginner teachers. Secondly, it remains true to strong pedagogic foundations, while considering how technology can be appropriately integrated to enhance language teaching and learning. Thirdly, it takes a broader perspective on practice to include detailed discussions about teaching practice and feedback, reflective practice, and professional development and research.Drawing on the author’s own experiences and research as a teacher and educator, incorporating international case studies and examples, and including guided tasks and activities that can be carried out in-class, as well as independently outside the classroom, Practice in TESOL is an invaluable practical resource for TESOL student teachers and practising teachers.

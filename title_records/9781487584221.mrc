A significant part of these investigations lies int he comparison of the educational systems of various countries. This topical account provides an overview of Danish education, in particular those parts of it which have special interest to the Anglo-Saxon reader. It deals with the present and past organization of the elementary and secondary schools in Denmark, technical and commercial education, higher education, which in that country is quite distinct from the North American concept of university education, and finally, adult education, a normal part of almost every Dane's life. In this last section the author has replaced the usual formalistic descriptions of organizations of high education with an exposition that gives a view from inside the system. The author believes that "an educational system is a mirror of the society it serves." His description is based on the assumption that for comparisons in education to be of value they must be studied in the sociological context in which the educational system has developed. With this theme the author presents a broad foundation for the study and comparison of the educational systems and societies of Denmark and Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

This book offers a wide-ranging survey of contemporary women’s short stories and introduces a new way of theorising feminism in the genre through the concept of ‘the moment’. By considering the prominent themes of motherhood, marriage, domesticity, sexuality, masculinity and femininity, this work engages with a spectrum of issues that are central to feminism today and, in the process, offers insightful new readings of the contemporary short story. Readers will find new perspectives on both canonical as well as lesser-discussed contemporary writers, including Kate Atkinson, Nicola Barker, A.S. Byatt, Aminatta Forna, Victoria Hislop, Jackie Kay, Andrea Levy, Hilary Mantel, Kate Mosse, Michèle Roberts, Ali Smith, Zadie Smith and Rose Tremain. While serving as a comprehensive introduction to the central themes of feminist politics, the study shows what makes the short story a desirable literary vehicle for creatively and critically contributing to feminist debates.Key FeaturesOffers a new way of approaching and theorising feminism and the short story through the concept of ‘the moment’Establishes an important field of literary study which will further extant criticism on both the short story and contemporary women’s writingProvides new perspectives on both canonical and lesser-discussed contemporary writers including Kate Atkinson, Nicola Barker, Aminatta Forna, Sarah Hall, Jackie Kay, Kate Mosse, Michèle Roberts, Helen Simpson, Ali Smith, Zadie Smith and Rose TremainProvides a comprehensive introduction to some of the central themes of feminist politics  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

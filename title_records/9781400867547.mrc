Brown's literary biography of Vladimir Mayakovsky. It is the only book to reveal the whole Mayakovsky, not just aspects of his tortured personality or artistic work, and will be immediately recognized as definitive.Mayakovsky contributed to the cultural life of Soviet Russia not only as a lyric poet but as a playwright, graphic artist, and satirist of the conventional art forms of his day. By examining his art in terms of his life, Edward Brown shows how intensely personal it was and how bound up in the literary and political history of his time. The intellectual turmoil of the period is skillfully re-created, especially the nature, ambience, and personalities of Russian futurism. Above all, the book reveals the man—a committed Bolshevik and a dedicated artist, but also a hypochondriac, compulsive gambler, and eventual suicide.Originally published in 1973.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

He has been variously vilified as a 'postmodernist', an 'overrated French theorist' and one of the 'intellectual imposters'. His comments on 9/11, Abu Ghraib and Europe's suburban riots have been eagerly sought and digested, and there is now a chance to read Baudrillard's texts in an overall historical, social and political context and for a cool re-assessment to be made of his life and work, after his death. This book concentrates on what Baudrillard has written over five decades and the order in which he wrote it. The Reader comprises extracts of Baudrillard's writings from the sixties to the noughties, with an editorial introduction and a concluding reading guide.Key FeaturesArranged chronologically in order of first publication in French, the Reader illustrates the development and interconnectedness of Baudrillard's work since the 1960s.Each section has an extract of one of Jean Baudrillard's writings translated into English, prefaced by a short bibliographical introduction setting the scene.The Reader will be of interest to general readers interested in public intellectuals, media events and contemporary theory.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

With the growth of the restoration movement the external appearance of many Old Montreal buildings was radically altered. McLean was the first person to restore a house in Old Montreal as a private residence and he describes how extra stories were removed, pitched roofs reappeared, facades were cleaned and re-adjusted, and greater discretion exercised in the use of signs. Wilson has watched this evolution with passionate interest and, through his evocative drawings, presents an intimate portrait of the architecture of the area. The Living Past of Montreal was first published in 1964 and revised in 1976. This third edition contains many of the original illustrations in addition to twenty new drawings which reflect the changes that have taken place up to the present day.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

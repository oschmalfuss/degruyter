Decisions on such 'hot-button' issues as abortion, race equality, the death penalty and gay marriage have sharply divided the Court, politicians and public opinion. Some say that the Justices who sit on the Court are merely politicians in judicial robes, while others insist that the Court simply does its best to interpret the Constitution for a society that differs drastically from the late 18th century when it was written. All those studying or simply interested in American politics must therefore get to grips with the nature, power and role of the Supreme Court in American politics.McKeever provides a comprehensive and balanced account of the Court, written and organised in an accessible style. It assumes no prior knowledge of the Court or constitutional law and readers will gain a full appreciation of this much-criticised and important institution.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

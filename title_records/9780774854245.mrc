Among them were ambitious easterners who accepted the challenge of the shorter but more arduous overland route across the prairies and the Rockies. One such man determined to find his fortune in the West was Thomas McMicking -- destined to lead the largest and best organized group of 'Overlanders' into British Columbia. His record of their epic journey is a valuable historical document that possesses the universal appeal of an adventure story. McMicking presents a vivid image of the hardships of the overland route, the dangers, both real and imagined -- like the apparently threatening Plains Indians who turned out to be 'our best friends' -- facts about important officials and settlements, and scientific observations of the physical environment. But this is also a very human document that describes a journey of self- discovery revealing a sensitive man's encounter with a bountiful and beautiful yet hostile and alien land. The journal is augmented by a valuable introduction, appendices on the Overlanders' trail and the McMicking family, and biographical sketches of many of the men who later played prominent roles in British Columbia's development and whose descendants became some of the province's best-known leaders and families. It is also enriched by the pictorial records of William Hind, a major Canadian painter who became known as the 'expedition artist.' Drawing on much previously unavailable material as well as on traditional sources, the editor has created a comprehensive historical framework for this unique document.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

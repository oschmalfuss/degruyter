Despite these notable advances, women are still largely underrepresented in parliaments and governments around the world. Why, after so many years of feminist struggle, are women still obstructed from full political citizenship by a glass ceiling? Manon Tremblay's 100 Questions about Women and Politics discusses electoral politics in Canada and abroad, focusing on women's rights to vote and run for office in legislative elections, political parties, voting systems, electoral "as for women, and participation in parliaments and governments. Against a background of observations taken from academic research, Tremblay uses an innovative approach by dividing her book into 100 questions and answers to address a range of important issues. Are electorates sexist or lesbophobic? Are family responsibilities a real obstacle to women's engagement in politics? What strategies are available to increase the number of female politicians? Are gender "as democratic? Once elected to office, do women represent women? How does women's political citizenship in Canada compare to that in other countries? A timely book on the unfinished work of representative democracy, 100 Questions about Women and Politics takes a comprehensive yet concise approach to demystifying the major issues dominating the study of gender and government.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

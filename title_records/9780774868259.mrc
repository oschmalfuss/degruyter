The Political Party in Canada explores the inner workings of these complex organizations through an examination of the composition and roles of key party actors (members and activists, candidates, local associations, donors, central officials, and members of Parliament), as well as the interactions between them. Contemporary parties play a key role in recruiting and selecting candidates and leaders, waging election campaigns, and organizing legislatures. Drawing on a rich trove of data from the 2015 and 2019 federal elections, this book offers a comprehensive examination of the composition, functions, activities, and power-sharing relationships that characterize Canadian parties. The authors focus not only on which groups are included in decision-making but also on what power and authority rest with each level of the parties’ respective structures. Basing its astute investigation on the themes of complexity, representation, and personalization, The Political Party in Canada provides important insights into a fundamental institution that makes modern democracy possible.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

The birthplace of this idea is its designers' traumatic experience as induced by the disconcerting condition of their abode.The thesis is that the eighteenth and nineteenth century's cosmopolitan projects that grow out of such deep frustrations trace the twentieth century's global democracy. This hidden origin of cosmopolitan projects dismantles the usual European representation of modernization as universal progress as myopic. Rather than being a generous action of prominent subjects such as Voltaire, Kant, and Goethe, or Bakhtin, Derrida and Deleuze, cosmopolitanism is an enforced reaction of the instances dispossessed by injury that search for the ways of healing it. Yet as soon as their remedy establishes itself as the ground for universal reconciliation, it risks suppressing other's trauma, i.e. turns from politics into a police. Articulating the author's position in the recent debates on the structure of democracy, the epilogue suggests an alternative strategy.   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 16.

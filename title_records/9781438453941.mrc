Previously an industrial powerhouse, the city's factories turned out essential items that helped the United States win two world wars. Following World War II, the industrial base of Yonkers eroded as companies moved away, contributing to an increase in poverty. To address the housing needs of its low-income residents, Yonkers built public housing, resulting in a nearly thirty-year court case that, for the first time in United States history, linked school and housing segregation.The case was finally settled in the early years of the twenty-first century, a time that also witnessed the continuation of the city's economic redevelopment efforts along the Hudson River and contiguous downtown area. Striving to once again become "the Queen City of the Hudson," Yonkers is being rebuilt beginning at its historic waterfront.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

Kennan was assigned as Secretary of Legation in Prague. After the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939, he stayed on in that country when most other Western observers had left. These diplomatic papers, letters, and notes are on-the-spot observations by a skilled and sensitive historian and diplomat. They offer a unique record of one of the tragic events in modern European history. Depicted here are the attempts at Germanization of Czech life, the cynical exploitation of various native organizations, the German insistence on a program of anti-Semitism, the take-over of Czech business and industry, the problems of currency and inflation.Originally published in 1968.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Conducting research is an important foundation for many undergraduates on STEMM career paths. But landing an extremely competitive research spot that is also an enriching experience involves knowing how to present yourself effectively and an awareness of your goals and expectations. In this book, an expert lab manager and a longtime principal investigator share their secrets for obtaining these coveted positions. Offering advice to students in a wide variety of STEMM fields at both research-intensive universities and primarily undergraduate institutions, Getting In helps students navigate the hidden curriculum of academia, unofficial rules that disproportionately affect first-generation college students and those from low-income backgrounds and communities historically underrepresented in science. The authors provide not only an overview of STEMM research and lab opportunities but also specific strategies for the entire application process—including how to write emails that get noticed by busy professors, how to ask for a research position during office hours, and interview questions to prepare for—so students can claim their place in research settings. With its emphasis on the many interpersonal and professional benefits of research experiences, Getting In equips all STEMM undergrads with the tools they need both to secure these valued positions and to develop habits that will build productive relationships with their future research mentors. As an undergrad, Getting In will help you: determine how much time you can spend on research by evaluating your current activity level and goals. find the time to do research without giving up your social life or risking your GPA. avoid common mistakes in the search, application, or interview that make it harder to find a research experience. write emails that get you noticed by busy professors by customizing the included templates. prepare for tough interview questions so you’ll impress the interviewer with your answers, and be able to determine if the position is right for you. As a research mentor, Getting In will help your students: navigate the hidden curriculum of finding a research experience in science, technology, engineering, math, and medicine (STEMM). set realistic expectations for their research experience. understand why conducting research requires effort and will include some failure and other challenges. be active participants in their success in the lab.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

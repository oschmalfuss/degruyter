The author starts out by examining L1 patterns which are transferred to less complex L2 systems. The data discussed was elicited by German learners of Spanish. A similar transfer is observed when L1 is typologically and genetically close, as in the case of French and Italian learners of Spanish. Furthermore, the author clarifies the relevance of intra-typological differences within the same linguistic family, including important differences in the lexicalization patterns of Italian with respect to French and Spanish. The findings contribute to our understanding of the field of motion event typology and thinking-for-speaking. The book demonstrates that conceptual transfer is present in different aspects of the motion lexicalization domain. Interestingly, there are some challenging aspects both for speakers whose first language is typologically different and for those whose language is typologically close. The book offers suggestions on how these challenges in the restructuring of meaning in L2 can be addressed in language teaching. Specifically, pedagogical translation and mediation present promising pathways to the strengthening of semantic competences in the L2.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Dedicated to Queen Elizabeth I, it was an ambitious bid to change the direction of English schooling. Mulcaster, who taught Edmund Spenser and Lancelot Andrewes, sets down propositions for a uniform political reformation of English schools. In arguing for public over private education, he promotes physical education, a closer control of the students admitted into schools, and ways to improve both the training and careers of teachers. He also discusses the teaching of women, school location, the role of parents in teaching manners and morals, and the need for uniform instruction and textbooks.This is the first authoritative edition of the text and an important primary source for the study of Elizabeth language and culture. It includes an extensive introduction with biography and background to Mulcaster’s wide-ranging ideas. The notes provide further background and explain the archaic forms of Mulcaster’s English style.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

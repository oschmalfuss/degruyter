Despite this, his body of work has been overlooked compared to that of his more famous contemporaries. This book shines a light on both the man and his work on ideological critique, the philosophy of history, international relations and political economy. The book also discusses Aron’s political legacy and argues that a number of his critiques and theories can help us address many of the problems and conflicts of the 21st century.Key FeaturesIntroduces Raymond Aron as both a person and thinker, and discusses his significance as a political theoristAnalyses a carefully curated selection of Aron’s political and philosophical writings Discusses Aron’s political legacy and shows that he developed a number of political critiques and theories that can help us address many of the problems and conflicts of the 21st century  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

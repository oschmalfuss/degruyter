These people recognized colonial wrongs and worked together in a variety of ways to right them, but they could not stem the tide of European-based exploitation. The book is neither an apologist text nor an attempt to argue that some colonizers were simply "well intentioned." Almost all those considered here -- teachers, lawyers, missionaries, activists -- had as their overall goal the Christianization and civilization of Canada's First Peoples. While their sensitivity and willingness to work in concert with Aboriginal people made them stand out from their less sympathetic compatriots, they were nonetheless implicated in the colonialist project, as the contributors to this volume make clear. By discussing examples of Euro-Canadians who worked with Aboriginal peoples, With Good Intentions brings to light some of the lesser-known complexities of colonization. This volume is an important resource for anyone interested in Canadian history, particularly post-Confederation history, and in Native studies and issues of colonization of Native peoples.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

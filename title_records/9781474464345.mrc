In an incisive and wide-ranging analysis, Cultural Pessimism: Narratives of Decline in the Postmodern World charts the growth of pessimism in the West during the last decades of the twentieth century.Drawing on studies from within a very broad range of fields, which include ecology, human rights, military history, international relations, criminology, history of science, cultural criticism and political economy, the author shows how cultural pessimism in the postmodern world can be related to the cumulative effect of four key narratives of decline:Environmental declineMoral decline Intellectual decline Political declineAfter a review of pessimism in other historical periods, each of these narratives is explored in depth. The book attempts to answer a number of questions: how are the narratives constituted and what are the conditions to which they refer? To what extent are those conditions historically unprecedented? To which cultures do the narratives relate? What values do they reflect? To what extent are the identified processes of decline seen as irreversible? Concluding that cultural pessimism is as much a matter of psychological and biological disposition as of intellectual judgement, Oliver Bennett's challenging book offers valuable new insights into how we view the prospects of the twenty-first century.Key FeaturesProvides an authoritative account of how the postmodern world has been represented as one of decline. Brings together different perspectives kept apart by professional and academic specialisation Views culture in its broadest sense as 'a whole way of life' Provides an historical overview of cultural pessimism, tracing its various manifestations from the modern period back to its existence in early religions Examines the biological, psychological and sociological factors that can produce a disposition towards cultural pessimismWritten in a clear, readable style, whilst maintaining academic integrity  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

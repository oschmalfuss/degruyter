This new book delves into the rich theoretical and practical knowledge advancements of recent years to synthesize the processes that facilitate hands-on learning. With in-depth frameworks, approaches, and educational principles, as well as an appendix of evaluation tools, Bogo's writing is both insightful and widely applicable.

Shortt defines the scope of the problems, clarifies the focus of the debate, identifies the constraints on policy formation, and discusses the policy options available. The author accepts the inevitability of substantial change to the health care system and the way practitioners work but believes that such change can ultimately lead to a better system of health care in Ontario. His aim is to persuade fellow doctors not to oppose change but rather to inform policy makers of what areas of physician activity legitimately demand intervention and how best to make changes. The Doctor Dilemma will be of tremendous interest to physicians and health care professionals, administrators, and policy makers across Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

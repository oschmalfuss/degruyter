The official ITIL® volumes explain what service management is, how the processes work and fit together, and why IT functions should adopt the practice, but they are notoriously vague on how to design and implement an ITSM model in a real organization. This challenge is best understood by those with experience of transforming ineffective and expensive IT, yet most ITSM guides are authored from a purely academic standpoint. Real-world IT Service Management This book provides guidance on implementing ITSM Best Practices in an organization based on the authors' real-world experiences. Advice is delivered through a Ten-Step approach, with each step building upon the successes of its predecessors. Subjects covered include: Documenting objectives, identifying current and future demands, analyzing service financials. High-level design, negotiating development priorities, creating an execution plan and roadmap, agreeing roles and responsibilities. Detailed design, building, testing, deploying. Monitoring and continual improvement. Each step includes summary lists of key questions to ask and specific actions to take, and a useful business case template is included as an appendix. A practical guide to ITSM As organizations seek to boost revenue, cut costs and increase efficiency, they increasingly look to IT as a strategic partner in achieving these objectives. Ten Steps to ITSM Success helps IT to prepare for this role by providing a detailed and practical guide to implementing ITSM best practices. It is aimed at ITSM practitioners and consultants, but will also be of interest to IT Directors and C-suite executives looking to transform the role of IT into a value-creating business partner, to establish a service management culture, and to drive improvements in their respective organizations.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

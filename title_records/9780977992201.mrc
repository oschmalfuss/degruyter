But the fact is that globalization is an historical process that has connected the world and influenced it, for better or worse, in every aspect of life. A World Connected: Globalization in the 21st Century is a collection of more than 100 thought-provoking essays by renowned scholars, journalists and leading policymakers published over the past decade by the flagship publication of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization, YaleGlobal Online. The essays are grouped by chapters on Global Economy and Trade, Security, Diplomacy, Society, Culture, Health and Environment, Demography and Immigration, Anti-Globalization, Innovation and Global Governance and offer insights about globalization trends for the future. The volume contains a general introduction by the editors and a preface by Yale University President Richard C. Levin.";As the story of globalization 21st century-style continues to unfold, reflecting on the lessons and challenges of both the recent and more distant past is critical to understand the options as we move forward -- together, as nations, societies, communities and individuals -- and the potential impact of our collective choices. This book will serve as an invaluable and thoughtful reference along the journey."; -- Tracey Keys, GlobalTrends.com  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

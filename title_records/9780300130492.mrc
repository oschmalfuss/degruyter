These stories, which were first broadcast on National Public Radio, focus on a range of individuals living and working in contemporary America, from an immigrant Chinese restaurant owner in New York City to an African-American waitress who helped integrate a Southern lunch counter, from the owner of a pawnship-wedding chapel to a retired couple who have become disk jockeys. As students listen to these stories, they hear a variety of regional and ethnic "Englishes" and are introduced to some corners of American culture that are rarely seen in the media.In addition to transcripts of the documentaries, the book includes thought-provoking exercises that encourage students to analyze the language in the stories and to respond in both oral and written form. A CD of the broadcasts is included. Also available are an instructor's manual and a cassette for language labs (both free).  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 08.

It was the beginning of an endeavor that ultimately required 35 years and three additional volumes.   In Volume 1, Scratches, Leiris proposes to discover a savoir vivre, a mode of living that would have a place for both his poetics and his personal morality. "I can scarcely see the literary use of speech as anything but a means of sharpening one's consciousness in order to be more-and in a better way-alive,"; he declares. He begins the project of uncovering memories, returning to moments and images of childhood-his father's recording machine, the letters of the alphabet coming to life-and then of his later life-Paris under the Occupation, a journey to Africa, and a troubling fear of death.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

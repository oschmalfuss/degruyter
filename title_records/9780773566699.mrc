The CCF/NDP had to contend with not only a booming postwar economy and a very popular premier but also a Cold War-induced phobia toward the Left and serious intraparty divisions. Despite this the party slowly recovered, led by a core of dedicated activists and employing an array of strategies, including the much-publicized transformation of the CCF into the NDP in the early 1960s. The author counters allegations that the CCF/NDP opportunistically abandoned its essential qualities (such as its socialist ideology or democratic structure) for the sake of electoral gain and that organized labour played a leading role in the party in these years, contributing to the dilution of the movement. Although the party sought new alliances among the province's less privileged groups, especially organized labour, it did so cautiously and even hesitantly, always conscious of the need to preserve its basic identity.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

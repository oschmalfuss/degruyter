For over a century, inhabitants of Shenzhen's villages have migrated to South-east Asia, the Pacific, North and South America, and Europe. With China's economic global ascendancy, these villages no longer consist of peasants dependent on their rich overseas relatives. As the villages have become part of the special economic zone of Shenzhen, the megacity that embodies China's rise, emigration has waned.Lineage ties have long been central in choosing migration destinations and channeling donations to village projects. After China's reopening, the villagers used diaspora as a resource to participate in Shenzhen's booming economy and to reestablish and protect their ritual sites against government plans. As overseas financial contributions diminish and diasporic relations change, Trémon highlights the way emigration is being reconceptualized in relation to China's changing position in the world, offering a new perspective on Chinese globalization and the politics of scale-making.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 05.

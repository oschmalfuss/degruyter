Europeans needed a thousand years to inculturate Christianity from its Judaic roots. Africans’ efforts to make the church their own followed a similar process but in less than a century. Until now, there has been no book-length examination of the Catholic church’s pastoral mission in Zimbabwe or of African Christians’ efforts to inculturate the church. Ranging over the century after Jesuit missionaries first settled in what is now Zimbabwe, this enlightening book reveals two simultaneous and intersecting processes: the Africanization of the Catholic Church by African Christians and the discourse of inculturation promulgated by the Church. With great attention to detail, it places the history of African Christianity within the broader context of the history of religion in Africa. This illuminating work will contribute to current debates about the Catholic Church in Zimbabwe and throughout Africa.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

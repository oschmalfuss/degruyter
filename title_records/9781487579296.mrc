It contains thirty-three articles, of which seventeen have never been published, written by doctors, psychiatrists, nurses, psychologists, sociologists, and social workers. The articles have been arranged in six sections. 'An Overview' contains articles on family planning from the perspectives of medicine, sociology, religion, and women's rights groups. 'Professionals and Volunteers' examines the roles of medical personnel, social workers, and volunteers in family planning. 'Government Reports' includes the recommendations of the First national Conference on Family Planning, and excerpts from the Senate Report on Poverty and the report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women. 'Contraception' surveys methods of birth control and services, and reports on a few selected studies in this area. 'Adolescents and Young Adults' deals with the problem of pregnancy and contraceptive services for teenagers and single university students. 'Abortion' presents the views and attitudes of various Canadian groups towards abortion, and includes an analysis of abortion as a public health problem. There is, in addition, a section on resources, with a glossary of terms, an annotated bibliography of Canadian articles, a list of films and teaching aids, and the addresses of major Canadian agencies dealing with family planning. This book will be of considerable use to all engaged in counselling, research, or professional training, as well as to those with a personal interest in the whys and wherefores of family planning.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

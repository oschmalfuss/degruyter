Over the past two decades, cinematic production has increased dramatically in Morocco, with Moroccan films leading at the domestic box office and being selected for prestigious international festivals such as Cannes and Berlin. And yet, Moroccan cinema remains little known outside of its national borders. This book asks why this might be and, in so doing, analyses the actual state of Moroccan national cinema beyond a post-colonial optic. Featuring interviews with filmmakers and key industry figures, such as Hicham Laari, Nadir Boumouch and Tala Hadid, the book explores Moroccan cinema’s transnational reach through a focus on the cultural politics of international co-production, the role of international festivals as alternative distribution networks, piracy and digital disruption, film education and activism."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

The challenges in the fields of work and family have been the focus of researchers for decades. Frameworks for work–family conflict, work–family enrichment, and work–family balance have been put forth in light of the complexity of the interface. Yet the relationship between the three stakeholders managing the interface (manager, employee, and spouse), has not received the attention it deserves. Work–Family Triangle Synchronization takes a holistic look into the triangle of forces involved in the conflict: the manager, the employee, and the employee’s spouse at home. Using the therapeutic triangle relationship framework, it elaborates on the dynamic of work–family triangles and offers a structured process for designing a psychological contract among the three players. This process is termed work–family triangle synchronization (WFTS). Based on the authors’ 20 years of academic research and field experience in the organizational and family domains this book introduces a novel synchronization model, methodology, and compelling tools. Personal anecdotes and stories make the text accessible and understandable, accompanying the reader step by step in the task of developing a synchronized work–family triangle psychological contract, as both a diagnostic and a management tool.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 04.

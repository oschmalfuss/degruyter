They have learned how to adapt behaviors to meet new challenges as effectively as they would change technology. Managing change in real-life ITSM projects Based on the real-life experiences of the author and other ITSM professionals, Catalogs, Services and Portfolios – an ITSM success story is a fictional account of change management surrounding ITSM projects. It tells the story of ITSM practitioner Chris as he learns how to deal with resistance to change and overcome inertia in staff behavior. Through his experiences, readers encounter the common challenges faced when implementing change in an IT Service Management context. The ‘tips that would have helped Chris’ sections are packed with helpful advice for anyone facing similar challenges. Catalogs, Services and Portfolios – an ITSM success story shows how the leading ITSM practitioners are able to: Deal with situations where being right doesn’t mean success Survive management pressure as others get fired around them Build credibility in the face of doubt and mistrust from their peers Separate good advice from bad Ideal for newly trained ITIL® practitioners The narrative style of the book helps readers understand how to manage resistance to change and the lack of empathy that often exists between IT and the business it supports. Presenting a realistic overview of an ITSM implementation, the book is equally suitable for newly qualified ITIL professionals and as an inspiration for team discussions. Read this book to learn from Chris’s experiences and transform your ITSM project About the author Daniel McLean is an ITIL consultant with over 20 years' experience in IT. He has spent the last 10 years designing, implementing and operating processes supporting ITSM.

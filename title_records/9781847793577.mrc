Drawing on a range of sources from the papers of landed families, this book provides fresh insights into the place of these women.Looking at women’s experiences of property and power in twenty landed families between 1750 and 1850, and outlining the statutory developments that impacted upon the distribution of family property in Ireland, Wilson considers how women were provided for and examines the legal, social and familial factors that influenced the experience elite women had of property. Individual examples demonstrate the similarities and differences between women in this class, and illustrate how the experience women had of property in this period was more complex than their legal and social status might suggest. This book will appeal to scholars in the fields of Irish history, gender and women’s studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

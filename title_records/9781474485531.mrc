This volume shows the diversity of approaches to violence in Islamic thought, avoiding the limiting characterisations of Islam being inherently ‘violent’ or ‘peaceful’.It shows how ideas of ‘justified violence’ – grounded in Islamic theological and juristic traditions – reoccur throughout history, up to the contemporary period. Chapters on earlier events provide context for contemporary debates on violence, showing how traditional legal and theological ideas (such as the sovereignty of God’s law and peace treaties) are used to both legitimise and de-legitimise violence.Violence in Islamic Thought from European Imperialism to the Post-Colonial Era is the final volume in the Violence in Islamic Thought trilogy. Taken together, the three books cover key aspects of violence in Islamic thought from the earliest time to the present day, mapping a trajectory of thinking about violence over 14 centuries of Islamic history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

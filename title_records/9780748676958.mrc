An emblem of the conquest of national and imperial space and of the staggering advances of science and technology, the train gave women a taste of its omnipotence, eventually becoming a space of emancipation, transgression, and fear for women. The book brings together the sensation, mystery, realist and early modernist railway narratives by female and male authors, analysing women’s trajectories within and beyond the city and the nation, as urban passengers, travellers, tourists and colonists. In texts by authors such as Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Margaret Oliphant, Rhoda Broughton, Mary Ward, Flora Annie Steel and Mona Caird as well as Wilkie Collins, Thomas Hardy and Henry James, the ambiguous space of the railway highlights the artificiality of the private/public divide, while giving rise to woman’s impulse to traverse boundaries, not only physically but also mentally and emotionally. In the novels, short stories in periodicals, news items and commentaries, essays, illustrations and paintings examined, trains become contact zones of multiple encounters, but also battlefields of gender, class and imperial ideology. Key features:The first full-length examination of texts by and about women which explore the railway as a gendered space within a British and European contextExplores a variety of cultural discourses which deal with women and the railway: fiction, poetry, news stories and commentaries, essays, paintings, and illustrationsProposes a reconceptualization of the public/private binaryConcentrates on many understudied writers of the nineteenth centuryIncludes 9 images to help illustrate the study"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

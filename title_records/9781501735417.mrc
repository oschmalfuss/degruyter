She treats little-known and unpublished writings, including many early poems. One substantial poem, "In Praise of the Masters," appears here in print for the first time. Discussing Pound's relationship to his Victorian predecessors, particularly Robert Browning and nineteenth-century historians, Gibson demonstrates how Pound's attempt to write a post-Romantic epic both confronted questions of genre and social order and led to the unpredictabilities of his politics. She develops a rhetorical tropology to account for the formal and cultural dimensions of Pound's contradictions. Exploring fin-de-siècle publishing, Gibson investigates how Pound's utopian political vision was rooted in nineteenth-century and fascist ideologies of gender. Violence is implicit in both. For Gibson, the aesthetic Pound and the political Pound, Pound the visionary and Pound the historian, are one.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The conference themes were inspired by the 2015 report of the federally commissioned Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation, led by David Naylor, which examined how the federal government could support innovation. A Canadian Healthcare Innovation Agenda features original commissioned chapters from academics and healthcare leaders addressing a range of issues such as the meaning of healthcare innovation, how a national healthcare agency and investment fund could be governed, the need for big data and evidence, adding value through Canadian supply-chain management, overcoming regulatory barriers to innovation, policy innovations for indigenous, military and elderly populations, the role of medical professions in promoting innovation, education, and the development of medical innovators. The Canadian healthcare system is so fragmented that any thought of a system-wide strategy for healthcare innovation is considered a far-distant ideal at best. This book presents a contrary view, outlining an agenda for Canadian healthcare innovation. It shows that Canada does indeed have the building blocks for innovation, and concludes that the time to act is now.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

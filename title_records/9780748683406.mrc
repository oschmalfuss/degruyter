A range of fascinating and rich source material sheds new light on the lives of women across Scotland throughout the long nineteenth century, demonstrating the pervasiveness of discourses of appropriate feminine behaviour, but also women’s subversion of this. It raises challenging questions for researchers about the identification of women’s voices, where these have been muted by class, religion, or ethnicity, while at the same time providing a methodology for uncovering these.Thought-provoking and innovative, this text will prove an invaluable resource for students, teachers and researchers. It will enable them to discover new ways of understanding the Scottish past and serve as a guide to redressing the gender imbalance of historical narratives.Key Features:Is the first sourcebook on Scottish women in the period 1780-1914Contains vital new material for students and historiansIs the companion volume to the Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women, also published by Edinburgh University PressWill stimulate local archivists and historians to look for similar sources in their areas"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

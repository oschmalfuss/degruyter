The book is without peer in terms of providing a comprehensive and thorough review of Cambodia's economy, from key economic sectors to social development to governance. On a country that still seems 'exotic' and sometimes difficult to penetrate, Dr Naron's survey provides valuable empirical analysis, insightful explanations, and practical recommendations for the way forward. The book ought to be required reading for every student, academic, or practitioner working on Cambodia.” - Robert Taliercio, Lead Economist, World Bank "The international community has observed with relief and admiration as Cambodia has made a remarkable recovery from one of the modern world's most awful tragedies. Much has been written about the country, but very little has been from an authentic Cambodian perspective. In this encyclopaedic and original study, Dr Hang Chuon Naron, one of the country's key economic policy architects, fills the gap. The author combines analytical rigour and careful attention to empirics with an accessible expositional style. A must-read for anybody interested in Cambodia, Southeast Asia, and post-conflict development challenges more generally." - Hal Hill, H.W. Arndt Professor of Southeast Asian Economies, The Australian National University "This mammoth volume on the Cambodian economy fills a major gap in the literature on Cambodia’s economic transition - one from a war-torn post-conflict state to a modernizing market economy. It traverses a very vast terrain, ranging from macroeconomics and finance - both private and public, to challenges facing agriculture, infrastructure and energy, to institution building and regional integration. As one of Cambodia's leading intellectuals, and policy-makers, Dr Hang Chuon Naron is uniquely placed to sketch this dramatic transformation, and tell the Cambodian story in a way that is insightful and revealing, yet accessible to a broad audience. This is a book that should appeal to more than just those interested in Cambodia's economy, or economists interested in issues of transition to market, but to anyone interested in Cambodia in general, or in post-conflict societies and the challenges that they face.” - Jayant Menon, Principal Economist, Asian Development Bank, and former Board Director, Cambodian Development Research Institute and sometimes difficult to penetrate, Dr Naron's survey provides valuable empirical analysis, insightful explanations, and practical recommendations for the way forward.

John E. Reinecke's study of the rise, function, and status of Hawaiian pidgin English up to 1935 and the competition of languages in Hawaii remains an authoritative treatment in the context of social history and of the evolution of makeshift languages and regional dialects. The book includes a full discussion of the origins and probable future of the creole dialects and languages of various ethnic groups brought together in the Hawaiian Islands during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The background of "pidgin" and other forms of non-standard English is dealt with in terms of the social conditions that resulted in their development.Based largely on personal observations made during Reinecke's years of teaching and Honokaa School on the island of Hawaii and on interviews and correspondence with local people, Language and Dialect in Hawaii is a lasting contribution to the study of pidgin and creole languages form a multi-disciplinary perspective.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

He argues that initially there was a broad consensus between Protestant and Catholic members of parliament on the way Ireland should be governed and on constitutional matters relating to the three kingdoms, but that this consensus was not shared by those who controlled the Irish council. He places particular emphasis on negotiations between members of the Irish parliament who were sent to England and the English council, and on the way events in Ireland influenced both English and Scottish opinion. In this context, the army raised in Ireland to counter the Scottish covenanters, and the failure to ship this army abroad before the rebellion broke out, were of crucial importance. Perceval-Maxwell contends, contrary to the opinion of other historians, that Charles I was not primarily responsible for this failure and was not plotting to use this army against the English parliament. The author explains the plotting that actually took place and provides an account of the initial months of the rebellion as it spread from county to county. In conclusion he reveals how the rebellion was perceived in England and Scotland and how these perceptions contributed to the outbreak of civil war in England. Why the Irish rebellion was important outside of its Irish context is well known but this book is the first to deal with how it became significant. It will be of particular interest to British as well as Irish historians.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Diminished rights is a unique qualitative study that documents the daily lives of vulnerable lone mothers and their children in Denmark. Loss of rights, gender and ethnic inequality, and family violence all emerge as key themes, with far-reaching international implications. The book: · presents vivid case stories to illuminate the voices and experiences of the women involved in the study; · identifies lone mothers as part of an emerging post-modern underclass in Denmark; · highlights the disturbing prevalence of domestic violence that pervades many lone mothers' lives; · raises questions around legal and child custody rights and the lack of redress in a patriarchal justice system. Policy and practice recommendations are made with wide-ranging applications for an international audience of policy makers, practitioners and academics.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

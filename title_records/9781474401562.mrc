Sebald, Reading the Times offers fresh insight into modern narrative. It shows how profoundly the structure and themes of the novel depend on attitudes to the clock and to the sense of history’s passage, tracing their origins in technologic, economic and social change. It offers a new and powerful way of understanding the relations of history with narrative form, outlining the development and demonstrating – through incisive analyses of a very wide range of literary texts from late nineteenth to early twenty-first century – their key role in shaping fictional narrative throughout this period. The result is a highly innovative literary history of twentieth-century fiction, based on an inventive, enabling method of understanding literature in relation to history – in terms, in every sense, of its reading of its times.Key FeaturesProvides a detailed history of the role of the clock and temporality in twentieth-century lifeIncludes incisive analyses of this role’s shaping of literary imagination traced in a very broad range of twentieth-century novelsProvides a unique, highly original literary history of the period’s fiction  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

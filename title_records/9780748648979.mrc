Is Islamic finance ethical? Is ethical finance Islamic?Islamic finance is routinely described as ethical. This reflects the fact that self-described ‘ethical’ finance is a large and growing sector of the market. It has a very positive image with which Islamic financial services seek to associate themselves. Yet the claim that ‘Islamic’ and ‘ethical’ are synonymous is rarely seriously examined, and nor is the claim that there exists a consistent and generally understood definition of ‘ethical’ practice. This book examines a wide range of financial institutions in the UK which fall broadly within the ethical sector, considering the nature of their principles and practices, and how they relate to Islamic models and to Muslim communities.Key FeaturesThe first systematic comparison of the principles and functioning of Islamic and secular ethical financial servicesIncludes case studies from retail banking, mutual associations such as building societies and credit unions, investment funds, high interest lenders and debt counselling, social enterprise, charities and the wider phenomenon of ethical consumerismProvides a comparison of Christian thought and secular ethical financial services with the Islamic traditionUses the UK as a case study due to its well-developed ‘ethical’ and Islamic financial services sectors  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

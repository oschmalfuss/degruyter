Well received by critics at the time of its release, the film continues to enjoy a devoted international cult following.This entertaining analysis of Hard Core Logo explores many of the film's key themes, including the responsibility of documentary filmmakers to their subjects, the development of close male relationships, and the relationship between art and commerce in Canada, especially for touring musicians. Paul McEwan examines Hard Core Logo in the context of other adaptations of Michael Turner's 1993 novel of the same name, as well as against other films from McDonald's celebrated career. Featuring interviews with McDonald himself and others involved in the film, Bruce McDonald's ‘Hard Core Logo’ provides an engaging look at one of Canada's most mythologized movies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

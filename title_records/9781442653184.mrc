Professor Pritchard recently found two copies of the complete poem in a collection of family papers at the Hertfordshire County Record Office and here presents a corrected edition of the first and previously published book, and the text of the hitherto unpublished books two and three.The poem is a major addition to the body of Cowley's poetry; it has close and sometimes surprising connections with much of his other work. It is not only the most extended and important of his political poems but a significant addition to the genre of the political poem. It is also unique as the attempt by a poet of stature to give epic treatment to the events of the English Civil War.Professor Pritchard provides a discussion of the personal, historical, and literary contexts of the poem in the introduction, as well as of textual problems and methods, showing the way in which the poem is shaped both by contemporary history and polemics and by classical and later literary tradition.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

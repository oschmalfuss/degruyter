It is not a set of "readings" in the sense that it makes available in a single volume numerous items published previously elsewhere: all of the contributions were originally written for inclusion in these Papers. This fact notwithstanding, the essays do not follow any one theme, nor are they given unity by a shared frame of reference. Each author dealt with some aspect of the 1962 election without any concern with what was being attempted by the others. As a result, the Papers do not pretend to give a complete and well-rounded account of the 1962 contest. When the careful and conscientious reader has put down the Papers he will have within his grasp a sort of do-it-yourself kit containing the materials out of which several election theories can be constructed . The authors hope that by unpacking and displaying the kit, they will have tempted many readers into trying to put some of the pieces together with the help of such additional equipment as they have acquired in their own observations of Canadian elections.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

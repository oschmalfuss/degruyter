While its start was marked by opposition from both the university's uncertainty of the field's importance and from the provincial government's concern about how such an institution would affect the government's control over forests, the faculty has produced a disproportionate number of leaders in world of forestry and beyond.Demonstrating the Faculty of Forestry's longstanding commitment to conservation and environmental stewardship, Mark Kuhlberg depicts its struggles with governments and the public to implement sustainable natural resource practices. Using unexamined archival materials, while contextualising the Faculty within the major educational, social, and political changes of the last hundred years, One Hundred Rings and Counting is a solid institutional history that also traces the development of conservationism in Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

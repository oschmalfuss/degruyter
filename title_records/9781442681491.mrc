With this book, Cynthia Comacchio presents the first historical overview of domestic life in Canada.According to Comacchio, the social anxiety resulting from an ongoing perception of the family as being 'in crisis' has had a significant influence on evolving social policy. Comacchio shows how families have both changed and remained the same, through transitions brought about by urbanization, industrialization, and war. Her many stories of individual families highlight both historical trends and the more intimate issues related to race, gender, class, region, and age.This is the only synthesis to date of the historical literature on Canadian families. Designed for students at graduate and undergraduate levels, it not only introduces the key concepts and approaches of a developing field of study, but also summarizes the major issues and trends that affected Canadian families from 1850 to1940.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

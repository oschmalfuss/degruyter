Through his organization, Wild Sanctuary, he has collected the soundscapes of more than 2,000 different habitat types, marine and terrestrial. With powerful illustrations and compelling stories, Krause provides a manifesto for the appreciation and protection of natural soundscapes. In his previous book, The Great Animal Orchestra, Krause drew readers' attention to what Jane Goodall described as "the harmonies of nature . . . [that are being] one by one by one, snuffed out by human actions." He now explains that the secrets hidden in the natural world's shrinking sonic environment must be preserved, not only for our scientific understanding, but for our cultural heritage and humanity's physical and spiritual welfare.   Krause's narrative-supplemented by exclusive access to field recordings from the wild-draws on a compelling range of personal anecdotes, histories, and examples to document his early exploration of this field and to lay the groundwork for future generations.   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

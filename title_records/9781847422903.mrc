How did this come about? What were the motives and methods of the people involved? Why did it come to an end? What effects did it have on the children involved and what eventually became of them? These are the questions Roy Parker explores in this meticulously researched work. His book - humane and highly professional - will capture and hold the interest of many: the academic, the practitioner and the general reader.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

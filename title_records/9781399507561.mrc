It considers coexistence as a historically and geographically specific arrangement and organising principle of a distinctly secular form of life. On the basis of ethnographic and archival field research in Lebanon, Raja Abillama shows that Lebanese law and civil, criminal and religious (shari’a and ecclesiastical) judicial processes converge to secure a place for muslims and Christians to articulate their legally intelligible religious difference and distinctiveness, to secure the religious in place, and to contain what cannot be made legally intelligible – namely, their religious passions. This book’s holistic account of the interplay of law and religion in Lebanon is a contribution to debates surrounding sectarianism and secularism.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

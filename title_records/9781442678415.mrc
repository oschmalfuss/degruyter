While the lectures maintain a continuity with Lonergan's previous work, they also reveal new and significant ideas, especially in regard to his drive toward a new conception of theology as a whole, and his particular concern for the relevance of theology to the spiritual life. The lectures here include 'The Redemption,' 'Method in Catholic Theology,' 'The Philosophy of History,' 'The Origins of Christian Realism,' `Time and Meaning,' 'Consciousness and the Trinity,' `Exegesis and Dogma,' 'The Mediation of Christ in Prayer,' 'The Analogy of Meaning,' 'Philosophical Positions with Regard to Knowing,' and 'Theology as Christian Phenomenon.' This volume provides a key to understanding the development of Lonergan's philosophical and theological thought, his major influences, and the pivotal moments of transition in the road leading up to Method in Theology and beyond.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

This collection brings together a series of influential papers from that moment, centred around the Italian anarchist journal Volontà and the international circle connected to it. Initially published from the early 1980s to the late 1990s, most of these papers have never appeared in English before. Remarkably far-ranging in their points of reference, these interventions are truly interdisciplinary, seeking to reinvigorate the intellectual heart of the anarchist ideal. Together, they form a treasure trove of anti-authoritarian thinking on issues as diverse as authority, the state, utopia, freedom, patriarchy and how we might envisage an anarchist approach to economics. In our era of ecological catastrophe and resurgent fascism, it is more vital than ever that activists and academics see the importance of thinking as anarchists.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

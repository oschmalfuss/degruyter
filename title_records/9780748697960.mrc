Assessing his complete works, this groundbreaking collection brings together a team of internationally regarded experts and emerging scholars from multiple disciplines, to provide a definitive account of Angelopoulos' formal reactions to the historical events that determined life during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Refusing to restrict its approach to the confines of the Greek national film industry, the book approaches his work as representative of modernism more generally, and in particular of the modernist imperative to document its allusive historical objects through artistic innovation.Retrospective in nature, The Cinema of Theo Angelopoulos argues that Angelopoulos' films are not emblems of a bygone historical and cultural era or abstract exercises in artistic style, but are foreshadowing documents that speak to the political complexities and economic contradictions of the present.Read the introduction online for free (pdf)ContributorsMaria Chalkou holds a PhD in Film Theory and History (University of Glasgow).Stephanie Hemelryk Donald is Head of the School of the Arts at the University of Liverpool.

This is the powerful message that Dr. JoAnn Manson--of the lead investigators of both the Women's Health Initiative and the Nurses' Health Study--and her coauthor Patricia Amend want to send to American women. Regardless of the barriers you may face--too busy, too tired, too "down," or too old--with this four-step practical plan you'll find the excuses falling away and a happier, healthier self emerging. This book offers not only state-of-the-art information from recent medical research but step-by-step instructions on how to get started and maintain a physically active lifestyle. The authors will help you choose a "core" activity that doesn't disrupt your daily life. Then they will show you how to measure your fitness level at the start, how to monitor your progress over time, and how to reward yourself for your efforts. These four simple steps to fitness will work no matter who you are--25 or 75, harried mother or overworked professional (or both), in good health or living with a chronic disease. The authors have included a clearly illustrated program of stretching and strength-training exercises; sensible activities for women with health concerns; an intelligent weight-loss plan; guidelines for selecting home exercise equipment and choosing a health club; and much more. With over 100 illustrations, questionnaires, and checklists, this book has everything you need to feel good, look better, and live longer, starting today--it's all just 30 minutes away.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

This brilliant and controversial book is a collection of the critical articles Gorky wrote that describe the Russian national character, condemn the Bolshevik methods of government, and provide a vision of the future. "An important book of as much interest now as at the time it was written."-Walter Laqueur "Untimely Thoughts is now timely. Gorky's journalistic pieces are immensely interesting as a commentary on a period of revolution, turmoil, and violence and on the play of forces trying to seize control of the country in a situation close to anarchy-that is, a situation very much like that of Russia today."-Gary Saul Morson, Northwestern University   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

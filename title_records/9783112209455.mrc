Egodi Uchendu explores this symbiosis, among other themes, in her latest monograph. Through participant observation and focus group discussion in addition to employing a wide spectrum of secondary and oral sources from numerous, well-informed interviewees in the study area, Uchendu investigates the emergence and spread of Islam in the Niger Delta. Her documentation of Islam's dissemination in Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River and Rivers States is unique as historical studies on predominantly Christian areas in Eastern Nigeria have primarily been focused on Igboland. Uchendu's work not only explores subaltern and gendered perspectives of Islam in the four states mentioned, but also her reproduction of large portions and sometimes, entire narratives from face-to-face interviews provide a rich tapestry of events and a more lucid treatise of the subject matter. In addition, the clear explanation of Islamic concepts and terms makes an otherwise technical discussion a relatively uncomplicated read. Scholars working in the areas of history, religion, politics, sociology, gender and related fields will find this book invaluable for researching multidisciplinary themes such as migrant-host exchanges, Islamic utility, religious conversions and reconversions, urban studies, patron-client networks and settlement expansion. This is definitely a book to possess for both students and researchers alike.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

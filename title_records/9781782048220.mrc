His work explored fundamental questions about existence and identity (both individual and national).Widely recognised and translated during his lifetime, he was an inescapably canonical figure on university syllabi across Europe and the Americas for many years after his death, and still appears on many curricula. In this Companion, a range of distinguished scholars with very different approaches both survey Unamuno's work chronologically, analysing major developments and turning points or breaks as well as continuities, and further study key themes and preoccupations across his prolific narrative, theatrical and essay output. All contributors offer not just incisive discussion of the texts or topics studied, but also a balanced overview of issues and debates arising in Unamuno studies. Julia Biggane is senior lecturer in Hispanic Studies at the University of Aberdeen. She is a general editor of theBulletin of Spanish Studies, and director of the Sir Herbert Grierson Centre for Textual Criticism and Comparative Literary History at the University of Aberdeen. John Macklin was Professor of Hispanic Studies and Head of the School of Modern Languages and Cultures at the University of Glasgow. In 1994, he was made a Commander of the Order of Isabel la Católica by King Juan Carlos of Spain.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

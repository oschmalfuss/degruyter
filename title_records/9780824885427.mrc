However, the continued study of measurements made at the interface between air and sea may lead to the discovery of how, and to what degree, energy is exchanged between these two interlocked systems, and, when related to world-wide photography and radiometry by weather satellites, how these data can help define the roles of the various elements in the total atmospheric circulation.These and other facets of general atmospheric circulation over the Indian Ocean are being co-operatively studied by Indian and American meteorologists.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The collection spans domestic, cultural and feminist magazines and extends to ephemera, novels and other printed matter as well as digital magazine formats. The essays examine both mainstream and independent publishing for women. They consider the history of publishing for women, the social contexts, and the ways in which the publications were used and understood by their readers over this long postwar period.The collection reflects in detail the important ways in which magazines and printed matter contributed to, challenged, or informed British women’s culture. A range of approaches, including interview, textual analysis and industry commentary are employed in order to demonstrate the variety of ways in which the impact of postwar print media may be understood.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

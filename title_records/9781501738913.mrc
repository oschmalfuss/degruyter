Its results are perhaps the most accurate available index of popular opinion throughout the country at the time the Bolsheviks took power.In the present volume, Oliver H. Radkey provides the most authoritative analysis of the election returns available in any language. The author's earlier account of the voting, first published in 1950 and long unavailable, is reprinted in its entirety. Radkey supplements that work with a wealth of new data, and reassesses his earlier findings in the light of current scholarship. Especially noteworthy is the new information on the vote of the non-Russian peoples and of various religious parties and special-interest groups. These data, the fruit of many years of painstaking research, are set forth in meticulous and substantial new tables.The results of the 1917 election are essential to an understanding of the range and depth of popular support for the Bolsheviks and other parties. Radkey's classic account will enhance ongoing debates about the course of the 1917 Revolution and the legitimacy of Soviet rule.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

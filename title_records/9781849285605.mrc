Organizations hoping to comply with any of the International Standards for management systems (e.g. ISO9001, ISO27001) must carry out internal audits. However, the requirements set down by accreditation bodies for auditor courses make little distinction between internal and external audit programs. As a result, many organizations instruct their internal auditors using resources designed for external auditors. Such internal audit programs often fail to develop beyond simple compliance monitoring, and risk becoming ‘box-ticking’ exercises, adding little value to the organization. Transform your internal audits and improve your systems A Guide to Effective Internal Management System Audits provides a model for the management and implementation of internal audits that moves beyond simple compliance to ISO requirements and turns the internal audit into a transformational tool that the organization can use to assist with the management of risk, and implement improvements to management systems. This book shows you how you can transform your internal auditing process to become a tool for development and continual improvement in your management systems. Start adding value to your internal auditing program.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

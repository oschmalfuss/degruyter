By telling the stories of how the go-alongs transpired and using detailed narrative description, Sam Stiegler shifts methodological attention to those parts of scholarly studies that often get left on the cutting room floor. Going Along with Trans, Queer, and Non-Binary Youth foregrounds process, not just findings, reflecting on the complexities of embodying the position of researcher and what it was like to do research with these participants. We, as readers, are compelled not only to see how these young people express knowledge about their worlds and their understandings of race, gender, sexuality, class, and age but also to appraise how we make sense of them in the course of our reading.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

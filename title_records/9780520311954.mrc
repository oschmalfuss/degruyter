This is the first scholarly biography of Robert Baillie, the minister, historian and participant in the revolutionary Covenanter movement. Baillie's life (1602 - 1662) spans the most important period in the history of Scotland as an independent state. The revolution began in 1636 when Charles I, Stuart King of England and Scotland, attempted to unite the reformed churches of his two kingdoms by promulgating a universal litany known as the Service Book. Baillie, though himself a conservative Royalist, joined the Scottish lords and ministers in signing the National Covenant, the document that led ultimately to the downfall of Charles and two wars with England. Despite his prominence in what became the Second Reformation of the Scottish church, Baillie managed to survive many purges and changes of regime, keeping detailed journals on the events of which he was part.

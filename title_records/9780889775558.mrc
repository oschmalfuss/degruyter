Grandparents have particular challenges in this situation, as they often have to battle their own children for custody, deal with pressures from caseworkers, negotiate their own health and financial issues, and address the guilt and resentment they may feel towards the missing son or daughter who conceived the children now in their care. As well, many fear their grandchildren will be taken away, which keeps them silent and isolated. This fear can be particularly profound for Indigenous grandparents, who bear intergenerational wounds of racism and colonialism as they struggle to create a better future for themselves and their grandchildren. No matter their background, grandparents looking for guidance and wisdom will find meaning in this brave and clear-eyed book.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

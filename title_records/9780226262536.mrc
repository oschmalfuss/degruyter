Taken together, these papers provide sound evidence about the effects of real and monetary factors on exchange rates and extend the analyses of exchange rates and international macroeconomics by outlining the kinds of behavior and institutional arrangements that can be incorporated into such analyses. Both empirical and theoretical research are represented, and the contributors analyze such issues as the performance of various models of exchange rate determination, the role of risk and speculation in the forward market for foreign exchange, the rational expectations hypothesis in such markets, the performance of monetary policy in ten industrial countries, the role that labor market contracts play in exchange rate policies, the effect of he oil shocks on the evolution of exchange rates, and the output cost of bringing down inflation in the open economy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

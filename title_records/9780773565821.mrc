Muszynski provides an interpretation of events that led to the creation of a cheap wage labour force of shoreworkers, their organization within the framework of the fishermen's union (UFAWU), and, as a consequence, the steady decline of their numbers until today they represent only a small portion of the labour force. She looks at factors contributing to the destruction of First Nations culture and economy, such as the displacement of aboriginal peoples from key fishing sites and work in the salmon canneries, and examines the structure and patterns of Chinese and Japanese immigration and the development of the capitalist class and the white working class. Cheap Wage Labour situates the history of B.C. shoreworkers within the much larger and more complex historical enterprise of industrialization, patriarchy, and colonialism and provides keen insights into the current fisheries crisis on the West Coast.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

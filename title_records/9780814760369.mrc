Winner, Book of the Year presented by the American Association of Hispanics in Higher EducationHonorable Mention for the 2015 Latino Studies Best Book presented by the Latin American Studies AssociationThelast two decades have produced continued Latino population growth, and markedshifts in both communications and immigration policy. Since the 1990s, Spanish-language radio has dethroned English-language radio stations in major citiesacross the United States, taking over the number one spot in Los Angeles,Houston, Miami, and New York City. Investigating the cultural and politicalhistory of U.S. Spanish-language broadcasts throughout the twentieth century, Soundsof Belonging reveals how these changes have helped Spanish-language radiosecure its dominance in the major U.S. radio markets.Bringing together theories on the immigration experience withsound and radio studies, Dolores Inés Casillas documentshow Latinos form listening relationships with Spanish-language radioprogramming. Using a vast array of sources, from print culture and industryjournals to sound archives of radio programming, she reflects on institutionalgrowth, the evolution of programming genres, and reception by the radioindustry and listeners to map the trajectory of Spanish-language radio, fromits grassroots origins to the current corporate-sponsored business it hasbecome. Casillas focuses on Latinos’ use of Spanish-language radio to helpnavigate their immigrant experiences with U.S. institutions, for example inbroadcasting discussions about immigration policies while providing anonymityfor a legally vulnerable listenership. Sounds of Belonging proposes thatdebates of citizenship are not always formal personal appeals but a collectiveexperience heard loudly through broadcast radio.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

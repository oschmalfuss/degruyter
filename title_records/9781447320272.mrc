It explores the ways in which both students and qualified social workers can be more effective in their writing through an awareness of the purpose, context and audience. It makes explicit the connections and differences between learning to write in university and communicating through writing in practice and explores the impact that new technologies have on academic and professional writing. Drawing on both research and examples from practice, Effective writing for social work is a valuable tool for students, educators, practitioners and managers to critically examine ways in which writing could better support best practice in social work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

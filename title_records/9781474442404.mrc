In Edinburgh, however, they banded together in a single body – the Edinburgh Incorporation of Mary’s Chapel.Building Early Modern Edinburgh traces the history of the organisation, which sought to control the capital’s building trades and defend their privileges. By utilising a range of previously missing charters and archival documents, the author offers a new perspective on the prestigious and important craft guild in its 543 years of existence. Developing a crucial theme of ‘composite corporatism’, and using the concepts of ‘family’ and ‘household’ to approach an urban institution, this book is a valuable resource of comparative material for the study of craft guilds and urban history in a global context.Key FeaturesUses the concepts of ‘family’ and ‘household’ to explore the institution of the craft guildDevelops the concept of ‘composite corporatism’, where multiple crafts were included in one corporate body – an aspect of European corporatism often missing from the historiographyUtilises previously unused sources, including a group of over fifty charters and five sixteenth-century minute books, which were lost sometime after 1923 and only recently rediscovered through the Mary’s Chapel ProjectDeepens our understanding of an institution which helped build a UNESCO World Heritage Site  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

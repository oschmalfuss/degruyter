Outstanding scholars, teachers, and administrators such as Watson, Williamson, MacKerras, Macnaughton, Dupuis, Shortt, Cappon, Goodwin, and Chown also figure prominently. The author examines in detail the role of the Board of Trustees, the Senate, and the undergraduate Alma Mater Society in the development of Queen's, and explores the complex relationships with the Presbyterian Church, the sister institutions in Toronto, and the provincial government. She shows how the distinctive character of Queen's was shaped by the Scottish heritage, evident in an emphasis upon flexible curricula, close faculty-student relations, and the virtues of student self-government, as well as in a sturdy independence in the face of repeated pressure for the concentration of higher education in Ontario. Imbued with a warm appreciation of the traditions of Queen's University and a scholar's critical detachement, this book is an important contribution to the history of institutional growth in Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

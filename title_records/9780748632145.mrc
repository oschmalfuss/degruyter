European innovators such as Chekhov, Flaubert and Kafka are compared to Irish, New Zealand and British practitioners such as Joyce, Mansfield and Carter as well as writers in the American tradition, from Hawthorne and Poe to Barthelme and Carver.Fresh attention is paid to experimental, postcolonial and popular fiction alongside developments in Anglo-American, Hispanic and European literature. Critical approaches to the short story are debated and reassessed, while discussion of the short story is related to contemporary critical theory. In what promises to be essential reading for students and academics, the study sets out to prove that the short story remains vital to the emerging culture of the twenty-first century.Key FeaturesA contemporary and theoretically informed surveyComprehensive coverage of the short story from its folktale origins to the present dayTwenty clear topic-based chapters covering British, American and world fictionFurther reading in each chapter together with an extensive and up-to-date bibliography of primary and secondary works Paul-March Russell's homepageContact Paul-March Russell: postcolonialshortstory@hotmail.co.uk"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

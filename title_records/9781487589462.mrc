This new study, the theoretical framework and theoretical discussion of which lift it out of the merely descriptive, contains a great deal of well-marshalled new material, from manuscript and ephemeral sources as well as from the printed Senate Debates Journals, and Reports of Committees. Little is generally known about the Senate, and of what little, much is erroneous. Professor Kunz's mass of detail and factual data, along with his evaluation of second chambers and of the performance of the Canadian Senate in particular, will do much to remedy this situation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Since the Nineteenth Century, popular participation has played an important role in challenging or confirming local hierarchies in Remo. This historical dynamic had a significant impact on Awolowo's vision both for Yoruba and Nigerian politics. When he moved into national politics in the 1950s, his career at the national level also gave him the opportunity to shape Remo's political identity. Awolowo was both a product and a producer of Remo politics.Based on a subtle analysis of local-level politics, this book argues that traditional and modern participatory structures play an important role both in Yoruba politics and in the African postcolonial state. At the same time, its focus on Awolowo makes an important contribution to the scholarly debate on one of Nigeria's most important politicians.Key Selling PointsThis book provides a detailed case study of relatively unknown Yoruba communityBased on a subtle analysis of local-level politics, the book argues that traditional and modern participatory structures play an important role both in Yoruba politics and in the African postcolonial stateExamining Awolowo as both a product and a producer of Remo politics, the book makes an important contribution to the scholarly debate on one of Nigeria's most important politicians.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

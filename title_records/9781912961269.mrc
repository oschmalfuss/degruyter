Published in two volumes and thematically structured in three Parts, this wide-ranging work both complements and expands on the subject-matter contained in the first volume entitled Technical Knowledge in Early Modern Japan (2020). Part I includes ‘François Léonce Verny and the Beginning of the “Modern” Technical Education in Japan’, by NISHIYAMA Takahiro; ‘The Role of the Ministry of Industry in Designing Engineering Education in Meiji Japan’ by WADA Masanori; ‘From Confucianism to Modern Technical Studies: Studying Mining at the Imperial College of Engineering (K?bu-dai-gakk?)’ by Erich Pauer. ‘ Part II includes ‘Education of Female Silk Reeling Instructors in the Meiji Period’ by SASHINAMI Akiko; ‘Kikuchi Ky?z? and the Implementation of Cotton Spinning Technology’ by Janet Hunter; ‘The Establishment and Curriculum of the Industrial Schools (shokko gakk?) in Meiji Japan’ by TODA Kiyoko. Part III includes ‘Transfer of Technology via Technical Textbooks: From the West to China and Japan’ by CHEN Hailian; ‘Translation of European Books on Natural Sciences and Technology in China’ by Christine MOLLMURATA; ‘Translation of Foreign Textbooks for Education in Japan’ by Ruselle Meade.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

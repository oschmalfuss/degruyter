While all examples and scripts use the “bash” command set, many of the concepts translate into other command shells (such as sh, ksh, zsh, and csh), including the concept of piping data between commands and the highly versatile sed and awk commands. Aimed at a reader relatively new to working in a bash environment, the book is comprehensive enough to be a good reference and teach a few new techniques to those who already have some experience with creating shell scripts. It contains a variety of code fragments and shell scripts for data scientists, data analysts, and other people who want shell-based solutions to “clean” various types of text files. In addition, the concepts and code samples in this book are useful for people who want to simplify routine tasks. Includes companion files with all of the source code examples (download from the publisher by writing to info@merclearning.com).

Presented by Julián Carrón, Giussani's successor as head of Communion and Liberation, Christ, God's Companionship with Man is the most succinct introduction to the breadth of Giussani’s thought, including memorable passages from works such as The Journey to Truth Is an Experience, At the Origin of the Christian Claim, Why the Church?, Generating Traces in the History of the World, and Is It Possible to Live This Way? Many speak of Giussani as a friendly presence, a man who believed that it was possible to live in faith every day and in any circumstance. As a writer and religious scholar who was deeply devoted to his work, Giussani’s teachings and reflections have come to generate worldwide recognition and support. Revealing that spirituality and community can be found in ordinary ways, Christ, God’s Companionship with Man will inspire all who read it.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

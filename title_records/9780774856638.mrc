While the articles represent diverse approaches and methodologies, they all point out that the specific needs of women are not being met and that women must create opportunities for democratic participation in the institutions that affect their lives. In the introduction, the editors develop the broad area of gender relations in urban society and describe how this field of study has evolved in Canada. The following seven chapters deal with women's experiences in the city, emphasizing the complex interrelations between individuals and their environments. Three main themes stand out in the book -- the changing relationships between women's roles as paid labour and in the household; the interconnection between public and private activities; and the way our understanding of these is linked to changing urban milieux. Specific policy areas, particularly housing but also leisure, recreation, and transportation, are examined by some of the contributors, while in the concluding chapter the editors discuss directions for further study and suggest appropriate research methods. The annotated bibliography -- in itself a major contribution to the field -- will prove invaluable to future scholars.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

accessuhttp://purl.org/coar/access_right/c_16ecfonline access with authorization2star  aVolume I of the first complete English translation of the chronicles of Fernão Lopes chronicles the reign of Pedro I (1357-67), dubbed both 'the Just' and 'the Cruel', including his dealings with the kingdom of Castile, the war between Castile and Aragon, and the revenge he took on the men who murdered the woman he loved, Inês de Castro.Until now, the chronicles of Fernão Lopes (c.1380-c.1460) have only been available in critical editions or in partial translations. Comparable to the works of Froissart in France or López de Ayala in Spain, the chronicles provide a wealth of detail on late fourteenth-century politics, diplomacy, warfare and economic matters, courtly society, queenship and noble women, as well as more mundane concerns such as food, health and the purchasing power of a fluctuating currency. Lopes had a keen eye for detail and a perspective especially attuned to the common people, and his chronicles provide an invaluable source for the history of Western Europe in the later Middle Ages.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

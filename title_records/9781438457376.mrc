A Postcolonial Self begins with a discussion of a Korean ethnic self ("Woori" or "we") and how it differs from Western norms. Choi then looks at the independent self, the theological debates over this concept, and the impact of racism, sexism, classism, and postcolonialism on the formation of this self. She concludes with a look at how Korean immigrants, especially immigrant women, cope with the transition to US culture, including prejudice and discrimination, and the role the Korean immigrant church plays in this. Choi posits that an emergent postcolonial self can be characterized as "I and We with Others." In Korean immigrant theology and church, an extension of this can be characterized as "radical hospitality," a concept that challenges both immigrants and American society to consider a new mutuality.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

Greengarten presents a detailed analysis of Green's thought, including his theories of political obligation, property, self-realization, and human nature, and developed the necessary tools for an analysis of Green's work and the tradition of liberal-democratic thought. He finds in Green a view of human nature and human potentialities which is in striking contract to the views of earlier liberal thinkers, and remarkably similar to that of Marx - despite Green's clear and often passionate defence of capitalism and market freedom. His concept of human nature is of a divided, self-contradictory nature; his theory of the true good is of a good that is to be shared, a common good that is not attainable through the selfish pursuit of private goods; his vision of the good society foresees the elimination of poverty, and the establishment of a classless society wherein all members would have equal opportunity to develop and realize their potential. This book offers a fresh perspective on Green and raises issues of importance in the field of social and political theory.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

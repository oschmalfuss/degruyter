It is not only a study of law as praxis that combines academic legal theory with judicial practice, but proposes both as central to humanistic jurisprudence and as a training in the conduct of public life. Drawing extensively on philosophical and legal scholarship and through analysis of literary works, Gaakeer proposes a perspective on law as part of the humanities that will inspire legal professionals, scholars and advanced students of law alike.Key FeaturesFocuses on the importance of judging for the humanities Combines legal theory and legal practice to show the importance of the bond of theory and practice in law and legal theory Incorporates the findings of philosophical hermeneutics and narratology for our continued thought on the position of law and literature, and law and the humanities as interdisciplinary movementsCreates philosophical–hermeneutical building blocks for a methodology for the humanistic study of law as praxisReflects on interdisciplinarity in legal studies against a backdrop of the tension between the natural sciences and the humanitiesLiterary case studies include: Gustave Flaubert’s Bouvard and PécuchetRobert Musil’s The Man without QualitiesDutch poet Gerrit Achterberg’s asylum poemsPat Barker’s RegenerationJohn Coetzee’s DisgraceIan McEwan’s The Children ActMichel Houellebecq’s AtomisedJuli Zeh’s The Method  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

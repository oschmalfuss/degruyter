It closes with her in New York, having accepted Horace Greeley's invitation to work as a book reviewer for The Daily Tribune. Her position was nearly without precedent for a woman, and she wrote enthusiastically of her job that it provided "a more various view of life than any I ever before was in." She found herself in a larger world: the new tasks of daily journalism replaced the demands of The Dial, and a mass audience replaced her coterie of intellectual readers.These were prolific years for Fuller, during which she wrote on a wide variety of subjects, and the letters chronicle her progress on a number of projects, among them her travel book, Summer on the Lakes, in 1843, which grew out of a trip to the Midwest; her translation of Bettina von Arnim's Die Günderode; and her essays on contemporary poetry, fiction, and drama. She devoted the fall of 1844 to expanding "The Great Lawsuit," an essay she had written for The Dial; the letters document how the piece grew to become her most important book-Woman in the Nineteenth Century, a provocative study of woman's role in American life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 20.

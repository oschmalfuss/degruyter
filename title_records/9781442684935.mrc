In addition, sedentary lifestyles, poor diet, and obesity continue to be major causes of chronic diseases. The Health Impact of Smoking and Obesity and What to Do about It synthesizes a vast quantity of recent data on the benefits and cost-effectiveness of both clinical and public health interventions in addressing the risk factors of smoking and obesity.A large proportion of chronic disease is preventable. The Health Impact of Smoking and Obesity and What to Do about It provides solid evidence and practical advice to health care planners, decision-makers, and frontline providers alike. The volume discusses various approaches to measuring disease burden and setting health care targets, and provides a summary of interventions of proven effectiveness. Taking into account the vital lessons learned from the experience of tobacco control over forty years, and focusing on the current state of the evidence for obesity control, the study stresses the importance of comprehensive strategies that deal with both individual behaviour changes and the need to encourage social contexts that enhance healthy choices and lifestyles.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

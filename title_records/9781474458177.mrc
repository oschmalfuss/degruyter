She presents competing viewpoints and introduces the central controversies in the field in order to give students the opportunity to evaluate and reflect on these in relation to the examples and data presented. Summary boxes, exercises, discussion questions, an appendix of research techniques and suggestions for further reading are also included to develop deeper understanding, generate reflective discussion and aid further study. Taking into consideration recent developments and advances in the field, coverage includes the acquisition of phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics, the nature of innate knowledge and learning mechanisms and new developments in performance mechanisms. Illustrated with examples from a wide variety of languages, this book presents an accessible and essential guide to first language acquisition.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Their experiences in Canada, she reveals, were shaped by class, gender, and ethnicity as well as familial responsibilities, government policies, and racism. In addition to conducting numerous interviews, Iacovetta has drawn on recent scholarship in immigration, family, labour studies, oral history, and women's history. Although both women and men struggled and were exploited, Iacovetta shows that they found innovative ways to recreate cherished rituals and customs from their homeland and managed to derive a sense of dignity and honour from the labours they performed.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

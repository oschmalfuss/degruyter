With the fiscal and political decline of its aristocratic patrons, the Buddhist establishment turned increasingly to lay commoners for financial support, using paintings to accommodate its new, and often subliterate, audiences. One type of preaching, known as etoki (pictorial decipherment), helped bridge the worlds of esoteric Buddhism and lay practice and reveals much about the role of art in the context of didactic storytelling and proselytization. Beginning with the provocative claim that the popularization of Buddhism in the medieval period was a phenomenon of visual culture, Explaining Pictures reexamines the history (and historiography) of medieval Japanese Buddhism. With theoretical sophistication and a full appreciation of the power of imagery to convey and control religious meaning, it investigates a range of aspects of etoki, including the particularly active role of itinerant nuns, whose performances were especially edifying to female audiences, as well as the visual hagiography of the reputed founder of Japanese Buddhism, the pictorial projections of Buddhist paradise and hell, and the explanation, through visual imagery, of sacred mountains. Part One presents the social history of etoki as it appears in a broad variety of written sources from the tenth to fifteenth centuries and investigates how etoki helped establish the cult of Shotôku Taishi. Part Two covers the period between the late twelfth and fourteenth centuries with a focus on Pure Land Buddhist propaganda and its use in etoki practice. Etoki sermons on the Taima Mandala, the visual description of the Pure Land Buddhist canons, show how envisioning the land of bliss substitutes for meditative concentration to gain enlightenment. Ikumi Kaminishi next turns to the itinerant etoki proselytes and similar performing artists between the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. These individuals preached on the road and through their missionary work reached out to commoners, turning etoki into an effective method of imparting religious beliefs and soliciting alms. In the late medieval period, audiences regarded itinerant preachers much like traveling artists and vendors, which has led modern scholars to conclude that etoki priests desecrated religious rituals. Kaminishi reconsiders this historiographical problem in relation to the social meaning of itinerant performing artists of the period. Finally, the she examines etoki’s effect on the popularization of sacred mountain worship (in particular Kumano and Tateyama)during the seventeen through nineteenth centuries. Chapters focus on the Kumano propaganda image used by nuns, how Christian religious imagery was exploited in seventeenth-century Buddhist propaganda, and the ways in which etoki campaigns made the remote Tateyama a popular pilgrimage site in early modern times. Explaining Pictures is an important groundbreaking work, the first book-length study devoted to the phenomenon of Buddhist art as religious propaganda and pictorial storytelling as a form of popular culture in medieval Japan. A truly interdisciplinary study, it suggests fruitful avenues of discussion between art historians and historians of Japanese Buddhism. Scholars and students with an interest in Japanese Buddhism, art, and social and cultural history will find its examination of significant issues fresh and stimulating. It will also find an appreciative audience among those concerned with the relationship between art and religion, the mechanics of proselytization, and Asian visual culture.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

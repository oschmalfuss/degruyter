Technical and vocational education, which before 1960 were confined to an enclave within the French education system, now permeate the entire system. Business and industry, long isolated from education, now play a major role in educational decision making. The French educational system today meets the demand for skilled personnel in almost all fields while maintaining "a complement of general culture." The first book in English to treat the important subject of technical education in France, Schools and Work places technical education within the larger field of French public education, including the administrative and political backdrop, European industrial development, the nature of work, and global competitiveness.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

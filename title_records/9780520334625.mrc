Sunday Times Expositions and Developments is the third in the legendary series of Stravinsky's conversations with Robert Craft. In this volume Stravinsky delves deep into his memory and brings to light, in the most absorbing detail, reminiscences of his childhood, youth and early manhood in Russia. A most remarkable evocation of St Petersburg, the city that the composer still loves best, forms part of the earlier, 'expository' section of the book. In his 'developments', Stravinsky moves outside Russia and unfolds a wealth of information and racy anecdote, most of which has a direct bearing on his music. The extensive chronological sweep of these conversations embraces not only a vivid account of how the Rite of Spring was composed and first performed but also his first thoughts about The Flood, one of his most recent works. This unique series of memories offers not only indispensable documentation but also exceptional literary distinction, and is essential reading for all students and lovers of Stravinsky.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

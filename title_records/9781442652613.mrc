This work will fill the need for such a text. Although the emphasis is on Canadian material, important decisions of international tribunals have been included. Cases, which form the bulk of the material, have been selected and presented with a view to facilitating discussion of the problems which most frequently arise in the practice of international law in Canada and in relations between the Canadian government and other governments. Documents and selected essays have been included as well when they will assist in understanding, or when there is a shortage of relevant cases. There is a survey of the general nature and sources of international law, followed by an analysis of the basic principles and how they have been applied in Canadian courts. Topics of direct interest to Canadians are examined in detail, and the work will be of value not only to teachers and students but to all those concerned with government and international affairs.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

We in our democracies are in them, and in particular those of us who have got themselves into our governments.'After The TerrorThis philosophical and moral reflection describes two worlds - ours of good lives and another of bad lives - and questions our complicity in allowing the bad lives to happen. With what morality are we to think of this? And of September 11th, and about our counter-attack, and what to do now?After the Terror is not moral philosophy detached from reality. It enquires into the 'natural fact' of morality and the worked-out moralities of philosophers. It reaches to the moral core of our lives. Ted Honderich asks why the events of September 11th were wrong and what terrorism tells us about ourselves and our obligations. He does not respect the moral confidence of our leaders and others. He defends a morality of humanity that requires us to think about our lives, and to act up against our democratic governments.Key FeaturesA serious work of philosophy that looks at the moral issues in the aftermath of September 11thWritten by a famous philosopher who is widely publishedA courageous, sceptical book that asks tough questions and makes us think about our valuesWritten with passion, conviction and honesty"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

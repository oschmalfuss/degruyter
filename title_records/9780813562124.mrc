Discussion of contraception and related topics (including feminism, religion, and eugenics) changed the way that writers depicted women, marriage, and family life. Tracing this shift, Craig compares disparate responses to the birth control controversy, from early skepticism by mainstream feminists, reflected in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland, to concern about the movement's race and class implications suggested in Nella Larsen's Quicksand, to enthusiastic speculation about contraception's political implications, as in Virginia Woolf's Three Guineas. While these texts emphasized birth control's potential to transform marriage and family life and emancipate women from the "slavery" of constant childbearing, birth control advocates also used less-than-liberatory language that excluded the poor, the mentally ill, non-whites, and others. Ultimately, Craig argues, the debates that began in these early political and literary texts-texts that document both the birth control movement's idealism and its exclusionary rhetoric-helped shape the complex legacy of family planning and women's rights with which the United States and the United Kingdom still struggle.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 21.

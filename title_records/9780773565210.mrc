They also explore the international and domestic contexts - military, economic, and political - within which defence industries operate. Edgar and Haglund's analysis draws on extensive interviews with political and industry leaders, military personnel, and government officials from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Spain, and Germany. This timely study of the domestic, American, and other NATO defence markets will interest scholars and students of Canadian defence policy, Canadian foreign policy, and Canadian external relations, and public servants, politicians, and personnel in the industry.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

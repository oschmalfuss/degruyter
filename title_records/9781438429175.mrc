In this increasingly complex world, there are many tensions inherent in the daily practice of school leaders. This book illuminates these tensions, and acknowledges the reality that there are already multiple approaches to decision making in any school. The authors offer a guide to integrate the influences of school and community members as well as data and organizational context into the decision making process. They focus on underexamined dimensions of decision making, including 1) the art of theory-use; 2) organizational context; 3) political dynamics; 4) inferential leaps and causal assumptions; 5) the role of intuition; 6) data-driven decision making; 7) the role of emotions and affect; and 8) making the tough decision. Dispositions that enhance success are highlighted. These ideas will empower school principals, superintendents, and other leaders to approach with confidence the decisions they are called on to make.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

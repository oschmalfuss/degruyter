It is a record of a carefully designed plan to include a worthwhile research experience in the educational programme of every student engaged in graduate education for the profession. In the introductory essay Dr. Albert Rose explains the methods by which this educational objective has been attempted and traces the evolution of the research requirements as a valid learning experience. The abstracts of 398 student projects provide a varied and interesting illustrative record of the students' work. These are not definitive studies but they are fertile in suggestive ideas; and the reported findings, though limited, are studded with clues for further and more intensive study in a wide range of welfare services and in different forms of social work. The result should be a valuable source of ideas for intending researches in this field both of what is known, and perhaps equally important, of how much is not known. The abstracts have been prepared by Margaret Avison, who has also provided an evocative introductory review.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

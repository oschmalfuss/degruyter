This book is designed for engineers as well as all readers that are interested in the systems around them and their roles with respect to these systems. It is a broad-stroke overview of system level concepts and how they connect to one another. It includes fundamental notions related to types of systems, their attributes, their architectures, and their performance. It is hoped that this exploration of various kinds of systems will provide some insights that increase the help we get from the systems we build, and also reduce the number of systems that are not working for us.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

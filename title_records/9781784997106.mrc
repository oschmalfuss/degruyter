Children are introduced to brands at an early age, and they have become increasingly brand conscious. As consumer markets have developed and become more crowded and competitive, so brands have become more important in enabling consumers to make informed choices. However, it may not always be in a child’s best interests to develop a preoccupation with brands, particularly if they influence the way they think about themselves. This book examines the emergence of brand awareness among children and the importance of their cognitive development to their understanding of brands and consumer socialisation. It also sheds light on problems caused by the emergence of new forms of branding in the digital era, especially in online social media and virtual environments where so many children now spend a great deal of time, and explores the implications for children and for regulators.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

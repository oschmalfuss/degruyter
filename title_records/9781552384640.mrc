These treasures contain and reveal each woman's life experience and act as vehicles for her values and for the development of her character. They are often passed along to other women or handed down to family members, thereby connecting generations and cultivating a collective women's history. Selected from interviews with over one hundred different women, these are rich, compelling and sometimes haunting stories, told in their own voices.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

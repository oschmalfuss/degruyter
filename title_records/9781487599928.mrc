Cyril James is particularly well qualified to observe modern Russia, and to comment upon it for Western readers. While he disclaims any right to speak with authority on the basis of his recent tour, the reader will quickly realize that he was actually given exceptional opportunities to see Soviet life, economy, and education – visiting some places that few foreigners have seen – and that, as a trained observer, he was able to draw fully from his experiences. As Dr. James points out, "it is imperative that we should learn all that we can about the U.S.S.R. in order to understand its people – their habits, their ambitions, and their thoughts." He describes most vividly how the system of research institutions and university education provides incentive and then a very fully occupied life for those who are gathered into it. The comparisons of university budgets, salaries, and student expenses with those of North America are revealing. Dr. James tells also of the interesting developments from Mr. Khrushchev's proposal that students should work in factories or on farms before going on to university.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

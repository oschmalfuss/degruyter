Kedem provides a new pragmatic approach to working with Deleuze across multiple disciplines, a rigorous demonstration of its critical and creative power, as well as extensive analysis of the relations between Deleuze and queer thought. All of which exemplify that despite – if not owing to – the unassuming role of sexuality in his thought, Deleuze proves to be queer thought’s true ally.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

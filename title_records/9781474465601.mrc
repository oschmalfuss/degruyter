The sense of its difference from literature has been heightened by its identification with daily newspaper journalism and reporting. Yet 'journalism' in its broadest sense refers to all writing in public journals, spanning both high and popular culture. It has been central to experiences of modernity, making its dismissal problematic.This book considers journalism in all its diversity, examining writing in journals across the cultural spectrum including literary journals, magazines and daily newspapers. Presenting a variety of critical approaches, the authors explore journalism's importance in relation to gender, modernity and modernism. They offer readings of established writers, critics and journalists:William HazlittCharles DickensHenry MayhewMatthew ArnoldWalter PaterDora MarsdenRebecca WestVirginia WoolfLaura RidingThis book challenges received ideas of journalism's significance in literary and cultural history, as well as perceptions of modernity and modernism.Key FeaturesConsiders journalism in both its 'high' and 'low' cultural formsExplores journalism's importance in relation to gender, modernity and modernismIncludes chapters on Hazlitt, Dickens, Arnold and Woolf"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

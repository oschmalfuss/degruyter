Grant participated in the fur trade, was instrumental in the early stages of ranching in Montana, and played a pivotal role in the Riel Resistance of 1869-70. His life and career exemplifies that of many independent Metis traders, and his memoir offers a fascinating glimpse into the Metis experience on the northwestern frontier in the last half of the nineteenth century. With an introduction by Gerhard Ens, Johnny Grant's memoirs will be of interest to fur trade and Metis history enthusiasts.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

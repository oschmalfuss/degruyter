This book brings together for the first time a team of experienced and highly respected researchers from across Taiwan with expertise in policy analysis theory and practice in specific areas of government as well as in non-governmental organisations. This is a well-structured volume which will be highly relevant for students and academics interested in understanding and analysing politics and policy making in Taiwan. Features of the ILPA series include: • a country-specific systematic study of policy analysis systems by government and non-governmental actors • a history of the country’s policy analysis, empirical case studies and a comparative overview of alternative approaches • a key reference collection for research and teaching in comparative policy analysis and policy studies  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

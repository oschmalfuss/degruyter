Hector Mackenzie assesses Reid's contribution to the creation of the United Nations in the mid-1940s, while David Haglund and Stéphane Roussel examine Reid's crucial role in the negotiations to establish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Greg Donaghy, Bruce Muirhead, and Alyson King write, respectively, about Reid as high commissioner to India, as an important influence on World Bank policy in the early 1960s, and, finally, as founding principal of York University's Glendon College.The authors challenge critics who dismiss Reid as an impractical and ineffectual idealist, demonstrating that his approach to policy-making was sophisticated and his idealism tempered by an astute grasp of the competing interests of a range of national and bureaucratic powers. Reid's reflections on Canada's place in the world remain as relevant and provocative today as when he wrote them.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

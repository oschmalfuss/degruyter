Now, Anne-Marie Slaughter-one of Foreign Policy's Top 100 Global Thinkers from 2009 to 2012, and the first woman to serve as director of the State Department Office of Policy Planning-applies network theory to develop a new set of strategies for the post-Cold War world. While chessboard-style competitive relationships still exist-U.S.-Iranian relations, for example-many other situations demand that we look not at individual entities but at their links to one another. We must learn to understand, shape, and build on those connections.   Concise and accessible, based on real-world situations, on a lucid understanding of network science, and on a clear taxonomy of strategies, this will be a go-to resource for anyone looking for a new way to think about strategy in politics or business.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

(It's good people no longer make blood sacrifices, at gas stations and stores, for example, and in the crunching gravel parking lots of small churches-oh but we do.) "The evening forgives the alleyway," Reginald Gibbons writes in his tenth book of poems-but such startling simplicities are overwhelmed in us by the everyday and the epochal. Across the great range of Gibbons's emblematic, vividly presented scenes, his language looks hard at and into experience and feeling. Words themselves have ideas, and have eyes-inwardly looking down through their own meanings, as the poet considers a lake in the Canadian north, a Chicago neighborhood, a horse caravan in Texas, a church choir, a bookshelf, or an archeological dig on the steppes near the Volga River. The last lake is the place of both awe and elegy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

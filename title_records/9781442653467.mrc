The first two lectures in the volume, by Robin Harris, Principal of Innis College, and Professor of Higher Education are entitled "The Establishment of a Provincial University in Ontario" and "The Evolution of a Provincial System of Higher Education in Ontario." They provide a full and illuminating account of their subjects which will be found invaluable for reference. Chancellor F.C.A. Jeanneret offers a gracious and impressive tribute to one of the leading figures in Canadian university history in "The Contribution of Sir Robert Falconer to Higher Education." Ole B. Thomsen, Secretary, Danish Ministry of Education, discusses one of the most vital issues in higher education today in "Relationships between Governments and Universities: A Danish View" Professor Algo Henderson, Director, Centre for the Study of Higher Education, University of Michigan, takes up another topic of discussion in "Higher Education as a Field of Study in the University." The collection as a whole is a valuable addition to intellectual history and a stimulating contribution to discussion of university affairs today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

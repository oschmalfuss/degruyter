The area has built an unprecedentedly brilliant ecosystem that has supported successful startups for decades now: Apple, Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Uber, Airbnb, and the like have changed the way that we work, play, and live in the twenty-first century. One of the least well-known keys to the region's success is the growing number of "accelerators" in Silicon Valley that help startups. Accelerators help by bringing a startup's product to the market, refining their business idea, developing their product, strengthening their team, designing a marketing strategy, attracting initial customers, and raising funds, all while coping with the unique hardships of the high-pressure startup life. Though short lived, accelerators act as a key behind-the-scenes early life support system. In Accelerators in Silicon Valley, Peter Ester explores in detail how these "schools of startup entrepreneurship" operate to empower startups, and thus bring success to themselves. The book ultimately asks (and answers) one key question: What can we learn from how Silicon Valley accelerators help startups to become successful companies? Accelerators in Silicon Valley is a book for anyone who shares a fascination for building a successful startup in an ever-evolving economy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0https://www.aup.nl/en/publish/open-access  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

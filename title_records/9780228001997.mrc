His Formula Growth Fund would go on to become one of North America's most successful investment funds, consistently outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and attracting the likes of legendary investor Sir John Templeton. Up and to the Right tells the story behind John Dobson's investment success as well as his many contributions to entrepreneurial education. Craig Toomey provides valuable insight into Dobson's unconventional but disciplined investment approach, his uncanny ability to predict winning stocks, and his unwavering faith in the market despite its many ups and downs. Coinciding with the sixtieth anniversary of the Formula Growth Fund, this revised edition brings the company's story up to 2019, presenting new material and case studies and describing recent developments, including how Formula Growth tripled its assets under management to $1.5 billion through the launch of a successful hedge fund platform and expansion into Asia. Based on interviews with Dobson as well as with dozens of members of his extensive network of friends, colleagues, and investment professionals, Up and to the Right is a fascinating story about a great Canadian who believed deeply in self-reliance and free enterprise as well as the value of friendship, pursuing one's passions, and working for the greater good.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

It offers an insight into the current and emergent business models and strategies luxury companies apply to remain resilient in times of change. It explores a variety of business models answering the following key questions: What is each brand’s value proposition used to attract a consumer’s willingness to pay? What is each brand’s target audience? How do brands navigate and expand their markets? And how do luxury companies organize their resources to design and develop products and services to continually sell to their customers? The answers to these questions provide the foundation of a luxury company’s business strategy and, as a result, its brand architecture. The authors also explore the patterns that have emerged in the ownership, management and the manufacturing in luxury goods companies, where dominance is usually found in certain countries. This book focuses on six key industries in the luxury product sector: fashion, automotive, hospitality, furniture, cosmetics and jewellery. It provides an international perspective with examples drawn from Europe, USA, the Middle East, China and Japan. Through these examples and cases, the authors analyze how luxury companies are facing the challenges posed by external shocks and an extensive need for digitalization. Using concepts and theories from macroeconomics (such as globalisation) and corporate and business strategy, the book aims to connect the dots between theory and practice. Resilience of Luxury Companies in Times of Change provides perspectives of the past, present and future – how luxury companies have evolved over time and managed to stay resilient despite the challenges they have faced through the different eras.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

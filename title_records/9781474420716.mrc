Through analysis of works by Jo Bell, Simon Armitage, Sinead Morrissey, John Burnside, Alice Oswald and Kate Tempest she demonstrates the practical use of cognitive frameworks as a means of understanding poetry and its effects. Gavins examines cutting edge concepts in cognition including world-building, conceptual integration, embodiment, and distributed cognition and develops our understanding of key notions in poetics such as poetic metre, performance, metaphor and intertextuality. Each chapter of the book addresses a central poetic notion or feature of poetic style from an innovative cognitive perspective, shedding new light on established ideas about poetic creativity and language.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

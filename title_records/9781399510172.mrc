This study adopts a multidisciplinary approach and covers the role of the state in Turkey’s initial industrialisation to the current period of restructuring and potential technological upgrading of its manufacturing base. The analysis traces how industrial policy has been shaped by state capacity, the waves of reforms following economic crises, the dearth of long-term finance for industrialisation and, more recently, the need to address issues such as low-tech industrial structure and pre-mature de-industrialisation.The authors argue that industrial policy is not a choice but a necessity for late developers to achieve structural transformation, and also that success is difficult and context-dependent with institutions playing a central role. They conclude that although the rise in protectionism and geo-economic conflicts is not as supportive as in the 1960s, the current global context creates opportunities for middle-income economies to implement effective industrial policy.The argument draws on comparisons with other emerging economies, with a special focus on Brazil. It aims to answer questions of what worked and what went wrong with previous policies. It asks how current policies could be shaped to overcome the problems of cronyism and corruption, and also achieve new objectives of technological upgrading and socio-environmental sustainability. To this end, the book poses broader conceptual and empirical questions of relevance to all economies undertaking industrial policies today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

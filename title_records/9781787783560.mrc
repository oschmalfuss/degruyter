This guide provides an overview of Agile for auditors, reviewers and project teams This guide covers: Agile project management audit objectives; The risks covered by each objective; What controls to expect and how these can be audited; Case studies illustrating Agile project initiation and high-level requirements; and Hints and tips for performing an audit review. For experienced auditors and project management teams, this guide demonstrates how they can adapt and reuse audit skills that they may have gained during traditional waterfall, CRAMM (CCTA Risk Analysis and Management Method), or PRINCE2® implementation/audits. For those less experienced, it will encourage them to consider these good practices and their application to Agile audits. An ideal introduction to Agile project management for auditors, project managers, Agile teams and students  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

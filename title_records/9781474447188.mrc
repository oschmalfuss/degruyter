This allows for deeper insights into the notions of power, identification, responsibility, language and externalisation.Gillian McFadyen argues that the British refugee regime has developed towards an externalised humanitarian hospitality. The British practice is geographically projected beyond the territorial confines of the state in order to both control and exclude the refugee. In tandem, McFadyen engages with counter-discourses by examining local practices of British hospitality and showing acts of solidarity that challenge the statist logic. The result is a theoretically informed account of the British approach to externalisation and geographical seclusion of refugees, particularly in response to the current Mediterranean Crisis  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

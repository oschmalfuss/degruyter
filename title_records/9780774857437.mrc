The first edition, published in 1987, developed an inclusive model of the broad field of child and youth care, which has since been adapted by educators, practitioners, and researchers across North America. Now this widely used text has been revised and expanded to include developments that have occurred in the field in the last decade. All the chapters have been updated, and two new chapters on rehabilitation and recreation have been added. The book covers a spectrum of key concerns within the field of child and youth care, and presents an analysis that spans a variety of program areas. The authors propose that the similarities across practice settings are greater than the differences, and they suggest that adopting an inclusive, generic view of the field presents opportunities for development and growth in a time of diminishing resources and support for services. They advocate a model of professional development for child and youth care that maintains a primary focus on the needs of children, youth, and families, and propose that by being flexible and adaptive, child and youth care practitioners can successfully navigate a difficult economic period and emerge as leaders and innovators within the human service sector. Professional Child and Youth Care is a practical, applied book that will be of considerable interest to students, practitioners, and educators in the field.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

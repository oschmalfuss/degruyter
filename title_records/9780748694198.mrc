It deals with themes including the nature of the power enjoyed by kings, how that power was maintained and how it was deployed; the interpersonal relations and struggles between kings and the elites within their kingdoms; and, the structures of governance through which power operated and was felt down to a local level. Late medieval Scotland is especially fertile ground for an examination of all of these themes as two new dynasties – the Bruces and the Stewarts – were faced with the challenge of establishing their own legitimacy and authority.Key Features An introduction to a period in history dominated by national identity and independence from English sovereigntyExpert assessment of the period arranged in thematic chaptersGives fresh insights into the period that draw on a wide range of sourcesExtensive further reading lists  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

In doing this, it recognizes the gendered nature of social work organizations, but, uniquely, retains simultaneously the valuable insights of mainstream organizational behaviour research, despite its often male context. Another innovation of the book is the targetting of non-traditional organizational behaviour audiences. For, where previous textbooks have tended to cater for managers, this book is aimed at the social work practitioner, and others who interact with social work organizations. Finally, the book uses real social work case examples to flesh out traditional organizational behaviour concepts, and, in doing so, also explains the impact of recent organizational changes upon social work practice.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

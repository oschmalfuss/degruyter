He examines their sexual roles, what the status of a woman's body was and what her own and others' attitudes were likely to be towards it. Professor Brulé does all this in the context of the development and achievements of Greek civilisation.Women appear not to have been highly regarded in ancient Greece, with female infanticide a common practice. Strains of misogyny can be heard in Greek literature, drama and philosophy: 'The most unintelligent people in the world' is how one character refers to women in Plato's Symposium (which also features Diotima, his best-known female sage). Women had few duties beyond the home, and the evidence that they existed at all is tantalisingly small. Yet by piecing together fragments and clues, the author gives us a vivid account of women's lives in Greece 2,500 years ago.Pierre Brulé's deft scholarship and engaging style make this fascinating history always readable, sometimes moving, and often entertaining.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

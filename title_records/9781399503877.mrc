The Treaty of Perth of 1266 was of significance in the state formation of both countries, and in the determination of their territorial boundaries. The laws and customs applicable in the Orkneys and the Shetlands remain distinctive due to Norse influence, centuries after those islands became subject to Scottish sovereignty. The extensive trading links between two countries united by the North Sea raises the question of how trade between the territories was regulated.This book brings together experts in Norwegian and Scottish legal, economic and political history to explore these points of contact. It breaks new ground, considering Scots law in terms of its historical interactions and similarities with another national legal system, rather than in terms of its place at the intersection between the common law and the civilian traditions.This definitive reference work will form the basis of future studies in comparative legal history, and comparative law more generally, in relation to Scotland and Norway.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

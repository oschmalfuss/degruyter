What if you could make a real lasting difference to your community and change the lives of thousands? The answer is to become an independent director (ID). Independent directors play a vital role in governing health services, charities, sporting bodies and educational establishments and can be especially effective in times of great change and uncertainty. Not only do they play a crucial role in steering and developing strategy, and managing risk, they are also the key to ensuring accountability. They are the people who ensure these organisations properly serve all of their stakeholders, be it employees, customers or the wider society. They are the real long-term custodians of organisations. Now, more than ever, these organisations are crying out for diverse, committed and engaged independent directors. The demand for impartial input is greater than ever before. There is no better time to step up and make a difference. Gerry Brown’s Making a Difference is the essential guide to becoming an ID, what to expect in that position, and what you can achieve once you are one. This book will inspire you to put yourself forward, take a seat at the table and get involved in organisational change. Democratising independent directorship is a powerful way to help transform policies from within and change things for the better.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

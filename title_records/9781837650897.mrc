This book examines the impacts of a century of casual but destructive visits from sailing ships of various nations followed by settlement by the East India Company; the fortification and population of the island by the Company, including the importation of an enslaved population; efforts to make it economically self-reliant; its employment a base for scientific observations from Edmond Halley to Joseph Hooker and beyond; its role as a prison-fortress from Napoleon to the twentieth century and as a base for anti-slavery patrols in the South Atlantic following the Abolition of Slavery; its decline since the end of the days of sail; measures taken to reconnect it with the modern world in terms of sea and air travel as well as electronic communication; and efforts to regain to some degree the ecological diversity of the virgin island setting.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

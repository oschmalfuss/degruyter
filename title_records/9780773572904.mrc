Over a million and a half Canadians gathered in churches, roller rinks, halls, theatres, factories, and even saloons to hear the likes of D.L. Moody, Sam Jones, Sam Small, Reuben Torrey, and J. Wilbur Chapman preach a particular brand of American revivalism. While at first these meetings were as successful in Canada as they were in the US, by the second decade of the twentieth century the support of Canadian Protestant leaders for revivalism had diminished. The American evangelists inspired their largely working-class listeners by talk of personal salvation, but, Eric Crouse argues, in an increasingly secular climate this inspiration did not lead them to become church members. The Canadian church leadership thus came to see the revival experience as costly and ineffective.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

These accidents are described as «severe accidents» because they can lead to radioactive releases outside the plant concerned, with serious consequences for the general public and for the environment. This book compiles the sum of the knowledge acquired on this subject and summarises the lessons that have been learnt from severe accidents around the world for the prevention and reduction of the consequences of such accidents, without addressing those from the Fukushima accident, where knowledge of events is still evolving. The knowledge accumulated by the Institute on these subjects enabled it to play an active role in informing public authorities, the media and the public when this accident occurred, and continues to do so to this day. The Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) is a public body undertaking research and consultancy activities in the field of nuclear safety and radiation protection. It provides the public authorities with technical support. It also carries out various public service missions entrusted to it under national regulations. In particular, these include radiological monitoring of French territory and of workers, management of emergency situations, and provision of information to the public. IRSN expertise is available to partners and customers both in France and abroad.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 25.

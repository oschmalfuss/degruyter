The data are just as dramatic in Canada, Europe, Australia, and increasingly, in countries in the developing world. As communities, governments, and health organizations worldwide struggle to avoid being swamped by health care costs – not to mention the impact of suffering and poor quality of life – the only long-term, sustainable hope must be based on prevention efforts.This book presents a promising new approach to educating, engaging, empowering, and generating action within communities as part of that broader prevention agenda. The authors review representative global experiences with community based prevention educators, focusing on the prevention coordination work that can be accomplished within geographical areas ranging from local communities to broader regions. Among the findings they reveal in this book are the fundamental elements of successful Community Based Prevention programs – skilled staff, high-quality evaluation, and sustained investment in prevention efforts.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

This volume attempts to analyze the relationship between Deleuze (and Guattari) and Marx and their respective works. This volume is an intervention into the fields of Deleuze Studies, Marxist and Marxian philosophy and political economy, and critiques of capitalism through an examination of the relationship between Deleuze and Marx. Themes that will be covered in this volume include hegemony and theories of imperialism, the role of philosophy in changing the world, surplus, tensions between the virtual and the potential, ideology and noology, modes of production, and the very nature of anti-capitalist politics in Deleuze's work. This volume will be of interest to people interested in Deleuze Studies who are interested in questions of politics and critiques of capitalism, Marxist theory and philosophy and people interested in political economy.Key Featuresoffers new perspectives on Deleuze's early workilluminates new connections between Deleuze's and Marx's workincludes a critical re-reading of Deleuze's workforegrounds a critique of Capitalism in Deleuze's workContributors include: Bruno Bosteels, Alberto Toscano, Jason Read, Jeremy Gilbert Simon Choat and Aidan Tynan.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

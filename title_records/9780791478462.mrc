Zimmerman offers a balanced presentation of the institutions and political processes of the Empire State. He begins with an overview of the state and offers chapters on federal-state and interstate relations; state-local relations; the constitution; political parties, elections, and interest groups; the state legislature; the governor; the "fourth branch" (the departments and agencies of the executive branch); the judiciary; and state finance, including state-local fiscal relations. Zimmerman emphasizes the legal foundations of the state as they influence greatly the behavior of leading public officers and interest groups. Most importantly, constitutional restrictions on the state legislature and local governments are examined, as well as the ingenious ways by which several restrictions upon the state legislature have been circumvented.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

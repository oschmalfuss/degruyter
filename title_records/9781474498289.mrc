B. Shaw, W. H. Hudson and Joseph Conrad Examines Graham’s jaundiced attitude towards the creation of the SNP Discusses the radical effects of WWI on Graham’s viewsR. B. Cunninghame Graham was a well-known and hugely influential figure in late 19th- and early 20th-century Scottish politics and literature. This book explores Graham’s early political views, his time as a Member of Parliament, his disillusionment with the Liberal Party and his reputation as the first declared ‘socialist’ MP. Using documentary evidence and tangible philosophical links, the book traces Graham’s early political influences derived directly or indirectly from key 19th-century figures, particularly William Morris. It also examines Graham’s anti-imperialist, anti-colonial and anti-racist speeches and writings, and his active support for women’s rights and universal suffrage.Lachlan Munro strips away the mythology surrounding Graham to reveal an altogether more complex picture, exploring his political and literary achievements, during a time of enormous political, economic and cultural upheaval – the reverberations of which are still ongoing.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

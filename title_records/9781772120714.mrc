It was Latin, whereby hangs a tale of monstrous extravagance… -- t…then Cree comes from the laughter of a cosmic clown, as he/she has been called, a merrymaker called the Trickster… -- tA Hail Mary contest, my dear friends and colleagues, is when the entire population of a village like Brochet kneels in a row on the main street with their rosaries jangling and rattling in their hands like the chains of love -- t…European languages are obsessed by the question of gender. They divide the universe into that which is male and that which is female… -- tAboriginal languages, on the other hand, divide their universe not into genders but into that which is animate and that which is inanimate… -- tSpeaking one language, I submit, is like living in a house with one window… -- tSpeaking one language, I submit, is like living in a house with one window… -- tMy paternal grandfather was a legendary fiddler, my father played the accordion, so I, third generation in this line of musicians, would become a pianist -- tMusic, as it turns out, is the original and only universal language, the only one understood and spoken in all 195 countries on this planet -- tMusic has colour. They say that F is blue. They say that G major is yellow. They say that A minor is black. D flat major is pink. -- tDig out the biographical details of the most successful men and women on Earth…and you will find, almost always, in that biography, the essential element of that sixth sense: musical literacy -- tThey should accept—and understand—that making the very arduous and painful effort of learning their language is an act of respect for their culture, an act of admiration, an act of love -- t…I would even venture to say that forcing your own one language down another person’s throat is not entirely unlike breaking into his house and stealing his spirit -- tStatement, exhortation, plea: it is our responsibility as citizens of this stunning country, this privileged land, to hold it together, to make sure it doesn’t fall apar -- tAlors, multilingualism is the greatest gift you can give your child… -- tABOUT THE AUTHOR0 arestricted accessuhttp://purl.org/coar/access_right/c_16ecfonline access with authorization2star  a“Speaking one language, I submit, is like living in a house with one window only.” From his legendary birth in a snow bank in northwestern Manitoba, through his metamorphosis to citizen-artist of the world, playwright, pianist, polyglot, storyteller, and irreverent disciple of the Trickster, Tomson Highway rides roughshod through the languages and communities that have shaped him. Cree, Dene, Latin, French, English, Spanish, and the universal language of music have opened windows and widened horizons in Highway’s life. Readers who can hang on tight—Highway fans, culture mavens, cunning linguists, and fellow tricksters—will experience the profundity of Highway’s humour, for as he says, “In Cree, you will laugh until you weep.”  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

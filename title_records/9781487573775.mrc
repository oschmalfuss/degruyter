From these interacting factors grows a style of building so native to the time and place that it seems the ‘natural’ response to that environment. This book, a substantial revision of the 1967 edition, treats construction techniques in the context of their environment and traces the history of various European and North American influences on methods of building in Upper Canada during the pioneer years. The author dissects a building to study its anatomy. With the aid of 475 photographs and drawings, mostly by himself and more than half of them new in this edition, he discusses the practical aspects of construction and the technical methods used in the erection not only of log and frame houses but also of mills, churches, bridges, and schools. Separate chapters deal with polygonal buildings, the woodworking tools of the period, exterior decorative woodwork, cobblestone treatment, and building with mud brick and with stone and brick masonry. New information on French building techniques across the continent provides a contrast with the predominantly ‘English’ methods of building in Ontario. Although the principal topic discussed in the book continues to be timber framing, particularly in houses, there are new chapters on barns and on plank construction. The book concludes with a greatly expanded chapter on preservation and restoration. The book’s emphasis on techniques of building and on details such as joints distinguishes it from glossier ‘picture’ books. It remains an ideal guide for everyone interested in early architecture and in the conservation of old buildings in Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

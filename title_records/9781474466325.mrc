Through an in-depth critical analysis of procedural decisions at the ICTY and ICC between 2008 and 2018, Sophie Rigney shows that there is a clear separation between fairness and rights in practice. Rigney demonstrates the various ways that fairness is invoked in international criminal law decisions – ways that are not always consistent, and are frequently at odds with defendants’ rights. She builds a new theoretical framework for understanding the concept and application of fairness and rights in international trials. In this way, she offers new paths for solving the problems currently plaguing those researching, designing, practising, adjudicating and being judged by international criminal law.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

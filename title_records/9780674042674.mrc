Deborah Rhode describes legal developments over the last two centuries against a background of historical and sociological changes in women's activities and attitudes toward these new developments. She shows the way cultural perceptions of gender influence and in turn are influenced by legal constructions, and what this complicated interaction implies about the possibility-or impossibility-of using law as a tool of social change.Table of Contents: Introduction Part One: Historical Frameworks 1.

Dodd, Bimonthly Review of Law BooksReviews of this book: A comprensive journey through the history of law and gender.The book is important in a number of ways.[It] paints in stark, irrefutable colors the irrational prejudices that have served to justify legal determinations limiting equality.[I]t has the audacity to ask the law to turn on itself and work more justly.--Sheila James Kuehl, California LawyerReviews of this book: Encyclopedic. . Thorough, carefully nuanced . [Rhode] gives all sides their fair due on every issue she takes up. A valuable resource for many years to come.--Susan 0kin, Law and Social InquiryJustice and Gender breaks the impasse created by legal and theoretical debates over 'sameness' and 'difference.' Deborah Rhode's brilliant analysis of gender and the law in the United States from the nineteenth century to the present argues persuasively for theories rooted in careful contextual analysis and for a legal emphasis on gender disadvantage rather than gender difference. This book offers a new vantage point from which to think about the role of law in building a just society.--Sarah M.

The introduction discusses some current issues and problems in education: the economic value of education to the individual and to society, the effects of automation, the role of the school in social and emotional development, vocational training and physical development, and the relationship between education and social class. The main body of the text describes the quantitative growth of the educational system and is organized into seven topics: characteristics of the population, school enrollment, the proliferation of educational institutions, university enrolment, enrolment in other post-secondary institutions, and the financing of the system. It contains much specialized statistical material including 46 charts and 225 tables, and will be an excellent work of reference.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

His introduction describes the background of Bacon's History placing it in the context of Bacon's work and the sources he may have used. Weinberger comments on the changing reputation and interpretation of The History and discusses its significance as a work of early modern political philosophy.The text of The History follows, accompanied by extensive explanatory footnotes. Weinberger's annotations establish the relationship of text to the surviving manuscript, the first printed edition, and the Latin translation. In addition, they show Bacon's differences from the earlier historians on whom he relied, explaining obsolete words, and clarifying matters of historical chronology and fact. In his interpretive essay, Weinberger discusses contemporary debates on how best to approach and understand The History. He suggest that Bacon's apparently contradictory work is a subtle and seamless picture of the modern state. The History is not just an account of the first Tudor monarch, Weinberger claims; it also presents Bacon's teachings about the moral and political ends of modern progress. At its deepest level, Bacon's work addresses the justification of modern times and reopens the ageless questions of political philosophy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 20.

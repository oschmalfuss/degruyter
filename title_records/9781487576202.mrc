The author, while making the necessary concessions to history, has pointed his selection of materials to the contemporary understand and use of the principles and institutions of land law with emphasis on Canadian cases and legislation. In notes and in comments to the cases reproduced, he suggests alternative or connected lines of enquiry designed to shake out some of the inevitability in which land law is often shrouded. His object is to introduce students (and lawyers too) to sharpen their critical faculties and powers of analysis and to use them in land law as they do in such subjects as Contracts and Torts. Lawyers and students will find of special value the complete index and table of cases. The index, in particular, has been very carefully designed to assist a reader in finding with the greatest possible speed the cases bearing on any subject within the field in which he is interested. Of equal importance to the reader is the inclusion of compendious references to the statutes of all the common law Provinces bearing on the particular subject matter.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

They show how concepts central to diaspora such as 'homeland', 'host state', 'exile', 'longing', 'memory' and 'return' have been deconstructed and reinstated with new meaning through each complex diasporic experience. They also examine how different groups have struggled to claim and negotiate a space for themselves in the Middle East, and the ways in which these efforts have been aided and hampered by the historical, social, legal, political, economic, colonial and post-colonial specificities of the region.In situating these different communities within their own narratives - of conflict, resistance, war, genocide, persecution, displacement, migration - these studies stress both the common elements of diaspora but also their individual specificity in a way that challenges, complements and at times subverts the dominant nationalist historiography of the region.Key Features:Includes 11 detailed qualitative case studies based on extensive fieldwork and researchProvides a counter history to prevailing nationalist narrativesEngages the new theoretical and conceptual developments of Diaspora Studies with the empirical richness and dynamism of Middle Eastern StudiesCase studies include Greek Orthodox communities in Syria and Turkey, the late Ottoman elites, the Ossetians in Turkey, the Italians of Egypt, the Cypriot Armenian community, Armenian diasporic tourism in Turkey, Palestinians in Lebanon, Malayalees in the Gulf, Iraqis in Egypt, and Lebanese diaspora literature  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

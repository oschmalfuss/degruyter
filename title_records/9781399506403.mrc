While its electoral fortunes declined with the rise of the Labour and (Scottish) Unionist parties during the 1920s, it remained a significant ‘third’ force in an increasingly crowded ‘Scottish political system’, particularly during the latter half of the 20th century. This was especially true following its 1988 merger with the Social Democratic Party to form the Scottish Liberal Democrats, when it helped shape the modern devolution settlement via the Scottish Constitutional Convention. This book examines both parties via a chronological presentation of their histories. Each chapter includes themes such as organisation, relations between the Scottish and UK parties, the deployment of ‘nationalist’ arguments and rhetoric, and strategic approaches (after 1922) to recover electorally and pursue certain constitutional aims including devolution for Scotland. It also presents a detailed examination of the party’s record in devolved and Westminster government after 1999.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

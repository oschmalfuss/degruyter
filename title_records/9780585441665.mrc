This fascinating new book attempts to counter this trend. Introducing the subject of wartime destruction of architecture and historic monuments, Nicola Lambourne compares the damage inflicted upon Germany, Britain and France and considers the use and abuse of this type of destruction in the lowering of morale and for propaganda purposes.Commentaries on large-scale destruction have focused more on the resulting human damage than on the effect on the architectural heritage, with the result that the bombardment of historic monuments has almost been taken for granted as an inevitable but essentially unproblematic aspect of 'total war'. However the debate surrounding the morality of this type of damage made it an important and highly visible issue during the Second World War and this book aims to recover the significance and resonance that architectural and cultural damage had at the time.Highly readable and including much fascinating detail, this book spans the areas of military, social, cultural and architectural history, placing the subject within the overall history of the Second World War in Europe and the longer term perspective of events between the 1870s and 1990s. Illustrated with forty black and white photographs, it will appeal to all those with an interest in the damage inflicted during Second World War.Key FeaturesTopical, in light of damage being inflicted upon the former YugoslaviaComparative approach - across country and subject area - makes this book uniqueIllustrated with 40 stunning black and white photographsEvokes the significance of architectural and cultural damage during the Second World War"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

The lost hat helps him to his first paying job -- tIII The schoolboy works diligently, studies, earns top marks and finds two friends -- tIV Something surprising happens. This is how we live: things always turn out differently from the way we expected -- tV Misi gets involved with strange families, and sees and hears things which are outside the school curriculum -- tVI Misi discovers the city's most ancient historic monument, which is not a ruined castle, not a palace, not marble or bronze, but a big three-hundred-year-old bush growing through a window -- tVII It is amazing how carefree and cheerful people can be around a suffering person. Is life worth living if the world takes so little account of heartache? -- tVIII Misi doesn't like people to fuss about him, particularly when he is in trouble. He wants to be left alone to think of home and contemplate the fate of humanity in peace, to forget his little catastrophe by thinking of big ones -- tIX Only God knows what will happen. Misi is happy that it is Saturday; he feels that his troubles must come to an end with the end of the week -- tX Misi wakes to a sad and difficult Sunday and looks into a dizzying future. Some unknown force pushes him forward onto a path which he would never have taken of his own accord -- tXI The little schoolboy endures all the sufferings of grown-ups who have to earn their bread -- tXII Misi gets a glimpse of his future. All his life he will have to work in desperate crises, in the same sort of extraordinary, amazing, chaotic circumstances as those in which he wrote his first poem -- tNotes0 arestricted accessuhttp://purl.org/coar/access_right/c_16ecfonline access with authorization2star  aBe Faithful unto Death is the moving story of a bright and sensitive schoolboy growing up in an old-established boarding school in the city of Debrecen in eastern Hungary. Misi, a dreamer and would-be writer, is falsely accused of stealing a winning lottery ticket. The torments through which he goes – and grows – are superbly described. The novel is brimming with vivid detail from the provincial life that Móricz knew so well and shot through with a sense of the tragic fate of a newly truncated Hungary.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

We think of the rogue employee who snaps. But in Blood, Sweat, and Fear, Jeremy Milloy demonstrates that workplace violence never occurs in isolation. Using violence as a lens, he provides fresh and original insights into the everyday workings of capitalism, class conflict, race, and gender in the United States and Canada of the late twentieth century, bringing historical perspective to contemporary debates about North American violence. Milloy has produced the first full-length historical exploration of the origins and effects of individual violence in the automotive industry. His gripping analysis spans 1960 to 1980, when North American auto plants were routinely the sites of fights, assaults, and even murders, and argues that violence resulted primarily from workplace conditions including on-the-job exploitation, racial tension, bureaucratization, and hypermasculinity. This explosive book reveals that workplace violence has been a constant aspect of class conflict – and that our understanding needs to go deeper.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

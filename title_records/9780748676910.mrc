Whereas 19th-century Scotland is popularly depicted as a mire of sentimental Jacobitism and kow-towing unionism, this book shows how Scotland's national heroes were once the embodiment of a consistent, expressive and robust view of Scottish nationality.Whether celebrating the legacy of William Wallace and Robert Bruce, the reformer John Knox, the Covenanters, 19th-century Scots rooted their national heroes in a Presbyterian and unionist view of Scotland's past.Examined through the prism of commemoration, this book uncovers collective memories of Scotland's past entirely opposed to 21st-century assumptions of medieval proto-nationalism and Calvinist misery.Key FeaturesDetailed studies of 19th-century commemoration of Scotland's national heroesUncovers an all but forgotten interpretation of these 'great Scots' Shines a new light on the mindset of nineteenth-century Scottish national identity as being comfortably Scottish and BritishOverturns the prevailing view of Victorian Scottishness as parochial, sentimental tartanry  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

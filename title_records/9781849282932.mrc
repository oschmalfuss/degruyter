However, with a major objective of IT Asset Management usually being software licence control, it is essential to first establish a comprehensive hardware asset listing, as software is always installed on a device. Therefore, without knowing the extent of your hardware assets, you cannot be fully aware of what software is installed where, which could cause under-licensing issues.   Investment will deliver a return Rewards to be gained from effectively implementing Asset Management are many and worthwhile. Although investment in an Asset Management project may not deliver an instant return, as the project starts to mature, opportunities to make savings will become apparent.   IT Asset Management: A Pocket Survival Guide is a quick reference style guide, addressing such serious issues with a fresh and pragmatic approach. Aimed at IT professionals who have been tasked with putting in place Asset Management disciplines, it first provides a commonsense introduction to the key processes outlined in the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL®), before proceeding to explain the various milestones of an Asset Management project. It will guide the reader through: building a hardware asset listing managing software asset inventory effectively, so compliance with software licences is achieved how to get senior management buy-in how to define, enforce and control procedures to manage IT assets more effectively for maximum savings.

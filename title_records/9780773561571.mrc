Anglicanism was an enormous advantage in achieving prominence. In addition, national origin was also an important political divider: the number of prominent Scots was even greater than historians have previously suspected while there was a consistent under-representation of native-born Canadians in the group studied. Prominence was usually bestowed from above, rather than achieved by upward striving and merit. Consequently patronage, having the right connections in the central executive government, was crucial to advancement beyond the first levels of prominence. Correct political views were necessary for advancement, but religion and nationality were at least as significant. Becoming Prominent includes an extensive appendix which contains the biographical data upon which the author's findings are based.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

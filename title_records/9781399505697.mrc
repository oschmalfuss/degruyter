Transnational Crime Cinema studies the production and reception of films from Europe, Africa, East and South Asia, and South America present crime as a discursive site where the terms of the nation and cinema gain new definition.Considered transnationally, crime cinema is a self-reflexive modality through which cinema reflects upon cinema’s own discursivity while audiences negotiate ideologies and imaginaries of nation against disruptive transnational economic and political pressures.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

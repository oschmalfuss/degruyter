It addresses how the faculty has responded to important social trends and changes in health care policy and helps the reader to understand contemporary nursing issues. Starting with the dramatic changes in health care policy after the Second World War, it establishes the role of nursing education as pivotal to a growing health care industry. The book then moves on to describe the challenge of developing an identity for an academic unit within the larger academic and health care structure. This book will be of particular interest to anyone involved in women's studies as it represents a case study for broader women's issues within an academic environment.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

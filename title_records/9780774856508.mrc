In recent years, dramatic changes have occurred which have catapulted Canada to the role of full partner in the Americas. These include Canada's decision to enter the Organization of American States as a full member, its involvement in the NAFTA negotiations, its important peacekeeping role in Central America, and its support for a process of hemispheric integration. Discovering the Americas describes and analyzes the evolution of Canadian foreign policy towards Latin America. The book is divided into three parts, each reflecting a distinct phase of Canada's relations with the Americas. Part 1 traces Canada's minimal relations from the beginning of the century until the Trudeau years. Part 2 examines the Trudeau era when, partly propelled by nationalism, Canada sought a more independent role in its relations with Latin America. Part 3 discusses the post- 1984 era, which has been marked by the prospect of an emerging hegemony in the Americas. The central thesis of this timely book is that changing hegemonic structures represent the most significant factor shaping Canadian policy in the region. Rochlin argues that the emergence in the late 1980s and 1990s of global trading blocs and the trend towards ideological convergence have opened up new opportunities for Canada in the hemisphere. Canada's role in inter-American affairs is becoming increasingly entrenched and is unlikely to recede.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

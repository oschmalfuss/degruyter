Even as steel girders buckled and groaned, he rushed back up stairs of the North Tower in search of people in need. Brian died a hero, one of more than 400 police, firefighters, and other first responders who perished that fateful day. Three years later, Vietnam veteran and retired NYPD Detective-Sergeant Jimmy Murphy is on a mission to find the truth behind his son's death. Why was Brian in WTC 1 that morning, had he anticipated the attack? Suspecting a cover-up of a deeper truth, Jimmy must confront his family, friends, and old colleagues in the New York Police Department to discover what happened to Brian and who his eldest son really was.Murphy's investigation takes him from his home turf in the Irish American enclave of Rockaway Beach to Muslim Atlantic Avenue and beyond in order find his own truth about 9/11. Dry-eyed and determined, Murphy battles barstool patriotism, the NYPD blue wall of silence, and a ticking clock—all the while carrying his own secrets, and troubled by the raw memory of his difficult relationship with his dead son. Written by author and musician Larry Kirwan, Rockaway Blue is a thrilling and poignant story of a family struggling to pull itself together after an unthinkable trauma.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

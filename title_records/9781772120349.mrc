Participatory theatre can break the uncomfortable silence, and with over 700 performances across Canada, Jane Heather's award-winning play Are We There Yet? has been an effective tool for teaching teen sexuality since 1998. The play and accompanying educational program were the subject of a major impact assessment where researchers from many disciplines examined how and why theatre can make change. This comprehensive, well-organized volume by two leading experts in community-based theatre offers a rich diversity of material and analysis. Theatre, Teens, Sex Ed will be a valuable resource for academics, practitioners, and specialist readerships in the fields of theatre, sex education, sociology, and public health. The play appears in the volume and is available separately as a reproducible PDF. A video production of examples of theatrical participation is included on a pocketed DVD. Contributors: Shaniff Esmail, Brenda Munro, Tracy L. Bear, James McKinnon, and the Are We There Yet? Community-University Research Alliance. Jan Selman is Professor in the Department of Drama at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. She directs contemporary and original theatrical work. Jane Heather is a playwright and Associate Professor in the Department of Drama at the University of Alberta. Both have worked extensively creating theatre for change in collaboration with communities.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

Faced with slow progress in alleviating poverty and stimulating economic growth, they especially need to end wasteful subsidies and revise inefficient tax policies. This book will help staff members of government planning agencies and ministries of finance and agriculture to analyze the effects of government policies on the production, consumption, and export of agricultural commodities.The analytical techniques that Isabelle Tsakok demonstrates in this book are the essential first step in reforming agricultural price policy to bring about a more efficient allocation of resources. After mastering the techniques of single-market, partial-equilibrium analysis, which are the book's focus, policy analysts can use the techniques to identify when more sophisticated methods, such as multi-market analysis and computable general-equilibrium models, are needed to determine what agricultural price policies are "right."Tsakok begins with graphical analysis and data requirements in order to build intuitive understanding, and progresses through steadily more complex techniques, demonstrating—step by step—the calculation of domestic resource costs, effective rates of protection, and related coefficients of protection. Providing a wide range of numerical real-world examples to illustrate the practical application of the partial-equilibrium framework, Agricultural Price Policy is an invaluable reference manual and teaching tool.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

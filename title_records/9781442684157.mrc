Censorship and Literature in Fascist Italy is the first comprehensive account of how the Fascists attempted to control Italy?s literary production.Guido Bonsaver looks at how the country?s major publishing houses and individual authors responded to the new cultural directives imposed by the Fascists. Throughout his study, Bonsaver uses rare and previously unexamined materials to shed light on important episodes in Italy?s literary history, such as relationships between the regime and particular publishers, as well as individual cases involving renowned writers like Moravia, Da Verona, and Vittorini. Censorship and Literature in Fascist Italy charts the development of Fascist censorship laws and practices, including the creation of the Ministry of Popular Culture and the anti-Semitic crack-down of the late 1930s.Examining the breadth and scope of censorship in Fascist Italy, from Mussolini?s role as ?prime censor? to the specific experiences of female writers, this is a fascinating look at the vulnerability of culture under a dictatorship.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Commentators with public voices repeatedly mobilised a Dickensian vocabulary to communicate their opinions about how and where London’s built environment should be improved in the mid-nineteenth century, or to justify proposed alterations. In analysing allusions to Dickens in a variety of archival sources, including dramatizations, press reports, political debates, and the visual arts, this book asks what cultural work is performed by literary afterlives, and whether we can trace their material effects in the spaces we inhabit.Key FeaturesIntersects with cross-disciplinary scholarly interests in studies of Dickens, histories of London, literary afterlives and urban studiesThe first study of how Dickens’s works were appropriated and mobilised by other people within his lifetimeOffers close analyses of literary and non-literary textsEngages with critical discourse around of literary afterlives  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

By delineating patterns of interaction between living and inorganic beings through the lens of this aesthetic concept, Lather maps a body of canonical texts onto the new critical terrains comprised by the new materialisms and cognitive humanities and reveals the points of intersection between cognitive processes and the material entities produced by them.The result is an innovative contribution to both Classics and New Materialism studies, uncovering the intimate and reciprocal interaction between minds and matter as central to ancient Greek aesthetic experience.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Why have most Muslim fundamentalists elsewhere been incapable of mobilizing mass support? In this compellingly argued book, Henry Munson, Jr., addresses these questions through historical and anthropological analysis of the roles of Islam in Middle Eastern society and politics.“This superb study will make excellent background reading for Americans interested in the contemporary world of Islam, but it also will lend itself to classroom use in courses on Middle East politics, religion, and society.”—Bruce B. Lawrence, Duke University“Munson’s book synthesizes secondary work in ways that are original, accessible, and important for a wide audience.”—Nikki Keddie, University of California, Los Angeles“The tone of Islam and Revolution is lively and provocative and the content is balanced and well-reasoned. This insightful and lucidly argued book will be as much at home in the hands of the general readers as in the classroom or on the scholar’s bookshelf.”—Augustus Richard Norton, United States Military Academy at West Point“The most exciting section of the book for the initiated is Part III, ‘Explanations.’ A rigorous discussion of explanatory models.”—Juan R. Cole, Middle East Journal“[A] stimulating book. . . . A fascinating case study in the re-invention of tradition.”—Roger Hardy, London Review of Books  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

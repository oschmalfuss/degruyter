Robert Coutts focuses his historical eye upon the character of the Church's evangelical approach within the settlement, its attitudes towards the indigenous peoples there, and the relationship between the Church Missionary Society and the Hudson's Bay Company. Within these broader themes, The Road to the Rapids also traces the development of St. Andrew's from frontier mission to rural Anglican outpost, as well as the changing nature of economic and social life within the parish as the century progressed. Accessible and well-researched, this book contributes a fresh interpretation of a historically important subject.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

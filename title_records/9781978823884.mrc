Corporate CEOs rarely conclude their working lives by resuming the duties of a mid-level account executive; on the verge of retirement, four-star generals do not return to the infantry. But in academia former senior leaders often conclude their careers by reprising the roles and responsibilities of a professor. Until now, leaders and institutions have been left to navigate these transitions on their own—often learning hard lessons that might have been avoided. Stepping Away moves beyond the well-worn clichés of “stepping down” to examine how senior leadership role changes impact individuals and the institutions they serve. Drawn from empirical research involving more than fifty college presidents, provosts, and deans, this book delivers fresh understanding of the challenges and opportunities leaders face as they assume a new place in the social architecture of their campus. Bridging the gap between theory and practice, Stepping Away translates research into practical strategies that leaders can use to make this change successfully, providing guidance about when to speak up and when to remain quiet, how to develop new relationships, where to office, whether to apply for new jobs, and how to use their knowledge and skills to add value to their campus communities, on-campus and off.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

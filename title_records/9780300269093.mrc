Confronted with growing resentment toward foreigners, Tab decides to return home to the banks of the Sázava River southeast of Prague. No sooner has he arrived than Tab finds himself falsely accused of a terrible crime and forced to go on the run with his two sons. Over the course of their peregrinations, dodging authorities by car, foot, and raft, they encounter a motley cast of allies and enemies. Tab’s sudden reappearance and just-as-sudden disappearance ripple through the community, catalyzing a chaotic chain of events that reaches a final, raucous crescendo. Hailed as “a picaresque romp of black humor and fantasy” (Times Literary Supplement), this is an unforgettable novel about finding the sparks of humanity even in the bleakest of places, in which love or the longing to find it lie around every bend.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

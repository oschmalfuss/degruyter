Attempting to understand her grandfather's passion and determination for making his own 160 acres of land in dry, sagebrush country led Professor Lisi Krall on a unique journey through the interconnections of economy, culture, and land in the history of the United States. She tells the story of the domestication of land in the United States, a story that hinges on the market economy and the agrarian and wilderness ethos as foundational land institutions. Drawing on institutional or evolutionary economics, Proving Up explores in detail the rich and ever-changing intermingling of culture, economic, and material conditions through American history. Untangling the complicated history of Americans' experiences with nature, Krall provides a critical focus and a timely contribution to the current debate surrounding our relationship to land and nature.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

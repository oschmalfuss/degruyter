These three volumes contain Kodaira's written contributions, published in a large number of journals and books between 1937 and 1971. The volumes cover chronologically the major periods of Kodaira's mathematical concentration and reflect his collaboration with other prominent theoreticians. It was in the second period that Kodaira did his fundamental work on harmonic integrals. The third period is chiefly characterized by the application of harmonic integrals and of the theory of sheaves to algebraic geometry and to complex manifolds.Originally published in 1975.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

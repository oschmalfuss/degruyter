It does so in the form of 40 questions and their answers. This is the second edition of the booklet that was among the contributions of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies to the observance of the 40th anniversary of ASEAN’s founding on 8 August 1967. The booklet provides facts on ASEAN’s establishment, membership, financing and decision-making. It recalls the association’s contributions to regional security. It explains what ASEAN is doing to integrate the regional economy and promote regional cooperation on the environment, infectious diseases, counter-terrorism, poverty reduction, and natural disasters. It clarifies such issues as non-interference and human rights. It touches on ASEAN’s relations with other countries and international institutions. Since the first edition was published in 2007, many developments have taken place in ASEAN and Southeast Asia, including the adoption of the ASEAN Charter. Hence, the need for an updated version of the text. Through this booklet and their other work, ISEAS and its ASEAN Studies Centre hope to contribute to the expansion of public understanding about ASEAN, recognizing the fact that regional solidarity, integration and cooperation are possible only with sufficient public support. As in the first edition, the publication’s design and cartoons are by Miel, the award-winning Senior Executive Artist and leading cartoonist of the Straits Times.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Often regarded as an embodiment of the self-effacing craftsmanship of classical and post-War Hollywood, films such as Broken Arrow (1950) and 3:10 to Yuma (1957) reveal a filmmaker concerned with style as much as sociocultural significance. As the first comprehensive study of Daves’s career, this collection of essays seeks to deepen our understanding of his work, and also to problematize existing conceptions of him as a competent, conventional and even naïve studio man.Key FeaturesThe first and only detailed study of this important American screenwriter, producer and directorAn international collection of original essays examining Daves’s films, including Broken Arrow, 3:10 to Yuma, Task Force and Spencer’s MountainContributorsFernando Gabriel Pagnoni Berns, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA)Matthew Carter, Manchester Metropolitan UniversityAdrian Danks, RMIT UniversityAndrew Howe, La Sierra UniversityJózef Jaskulski, University of WarsawSue Matheson, University College of the North in Manitoba Andrew Patrick Nelson, Montana State UniversityFran Pheasant-Kelly, University of WolverhamptonJoseph Pomp, Harvard UniversityJohn White, Anglia Ruskin University  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

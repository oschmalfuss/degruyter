In an industry that had placed faith in selling soap rather than serving the educational needs of its wide audiences, Sesame Street, one of the most popular children's programs to date was created. Big Bird & Beyond discusses the large role Morrisett played since 1969, as president of The John and Mary R. Markle Foundation and as chairman of the Chilren's Television Workshop. He launched Peggy Charren's Action for Children's Television, saved the Columbia Journalism Review and the Fund for Investigative Journalism from bankruptcy, established the National News Council, and led to Cable News Network providing more issue oriented presidential election coverage. In this read, Lee Mitgang notes how Markle promoted the idea of using computers and the Internet to enrich the lives of the elderly, and, most recently, how electronic mail might connect citizens more effectively to government and other institutions that affect their everyday lives.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

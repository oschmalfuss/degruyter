In Between Education and Catastrophe, George Buri connects the educational debates of the 1950s to the broader Canadian postwar political conversation about the social welfare state and Keynesian versus laissez-faire models of liberalism. Working skilfully with primary sources, contemporary publications, and a rich array of secondary sources, Buri examines debates over curricula, the purpose of high school, teacher training, rural schools, and standardized testing in Manitoba. The progressives who advocated for a "new liberalism" - characterized by government intervention and the social welfare state - sought to create a system of public schooling that would both equip students to succeed and enlarge their political vision by encouraging compromise and democratic decision making. They promoted more practical subjects, child-centred classrooms, and the use of psychological expertise to promote "life adjustment." Meanwhile, self-styled traditionalists such as Hilda Neatby thought progressive education undermined the individual competition and achievement at the root of a laissez-faire economy, calling for a return to the basics, an elimination of "frill" subjects, and a more academic focus for the public education system. A frank consideration of conflict, power, and influence within school systems, Between Education and Catastrophe brings to light compelling social, cultural, and philosophical themes within the history of education in Manitoba.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

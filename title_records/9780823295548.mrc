Brennen's primary intention for this project is to give voice to these newsworkers, investigating their work environment, routines, and expectations. Journalists shared their favorite stories, best interviews, greatest challenges, and most frustrating experiences with Brennen.In giving voice to those previously marginalized, this oral history project may help us to reach a deeper understanding of the challenges and realities newsworkers face in the United States.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 17.

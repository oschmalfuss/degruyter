The authors identify six key issues to be addressed: developing evidence-based approaches to change - using the research; recovering from addiction to failing ways of working; taking community involvement seriously; getting beyond zero-sum power games and establishing trust; 'Best Value': the making or breaking of holistic government and joined-up action; real change takes time. Implementing holistic government describes what needs to happen to move beyond the policy and management rhetoric of partnership and consultation to real joined-up action on the ground. Central to this is the creation of empowered front-line professional teams working in partnership with local communities for sustainable quality of life improvement as experienced by local people. The report concludes with policy recommendations, giving clear direction and support to the translation of rhetoric to reality on the ground.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

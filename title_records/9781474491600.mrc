This book discusses whether the pro-immigration strategies implemented by the Scottish political leadership could be employed elsewhere, addressing ongoing public debates about minority integration and multiculturalism in Western democracies, and the potential power of local or national political elites to steer rhetoric against anti-immigrant forces.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

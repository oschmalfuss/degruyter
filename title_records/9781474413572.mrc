This book explores the adaptation of children’s metafictions, including works such as Inkheart, The Invention of Hugo Cabret and the Harry Potter series. Not only are the plot devices of books and reading explored on screen in these adaptations, but so is the nature of transmedial adaptation itself – the act of representing one work of art in another medium. Analysing the ‘work’ done by children’s metafiction and the experience of reading it, Casie E. Hermansson situates the adaptations of these types of books to film within contemporary adaptation criticism.Case studies include:HugoA Series of Unfortunate EventsThe Spiderwick ChroniclesHarry PotterInkheart  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

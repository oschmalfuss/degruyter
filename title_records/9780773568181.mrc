In its first eighty years the School has grown and changed, greatly expanding the range of programs it offers to a dramatically increased number of undergraduates and graduates. A series of programs for executives and a productive and research-oriented faculty also demonstrate the growth and dynamic achievements of the School. This success is even more remarkable when it is recognized that it took place far from the commercial centres of Canada and the United States. Getting Down to Business is the fascinating story of Queen's School of Business, and of the men and women who recognized that there was a growing demand for professionally trained managers and ensured that Queen's would play a leading role in addressing that need.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

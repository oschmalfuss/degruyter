Marilyn Watkins examines the stable political climate built by successive waves of Populism, socialism, the farmer-labor movement, and the Grange, in turn-of-the-century western Washington. She shows how all of these movements drew upon the same community base, empowered farmers, and encouraged them in the belief that democracy, independence, and prosperity were realizable goals. Indeed they were—in a setting where agriculture was diversified, farmers were debt-free, and, critically,women enjoyed equal status as activists in social movements.Rural Democracy illuminates the problems that undermined Populism and other forms of rural radicalism in the South and the Midwest by demonstrating the political success of those movements where such problems were notably absent: in Lewis County, Washington. By so doing, Watkins convincingly demonstrates the continuing value of local community studies in understanding the large-scale transformations that continue to sweep over rural America.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

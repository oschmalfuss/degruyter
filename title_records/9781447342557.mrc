Policies and guidance on how to approach these sensitive areas are emerging. This book provides busy practitioners with a ready reference for the day-to-day problems that they are likely to face in key areas of engagement, such as promoting sexual health, preventing sexual violence, working with those subjected to sexual abuse, and engaging with the complexities of contemporary sexualities. The book: · reviews current policy in each area; · outlines the relevant guidance; · and provides links to further reading and other helpful sources of information. Concise but comprehensive, practical and accessible, the book is realistic in terms of what services practitioners can provide. Sexual issues in social work is essential reading for anyone who works with others where sex and sexuality have become part of the practice concerns.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

In this collection of traditional oral narratives and legends, which have been passed from generation to generation for centuries, the elders tell the story of their people. Many of the stories were told in the original Nlha7k�pmx language but have been carefully translated so as to retain much of the colour and detail of the original, including the rich dialogue so often missing in translations. Altogether, over twenty story-tellers participated in the project. Put together entirely by Nlha7k�pmx people, Our Tellings reveals how they perceive their own history. It is their hope that through sharing these stories, they will inspire others to continue to create stories and to contribute to the cultural revitalization of Canada's Native peoples.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

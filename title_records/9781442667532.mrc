Beyond Persuasion provides healthcare managers with a guide to using strategic communication to meet both personal and professional objectives in the digital age.Whether healthcare managers are conducting meetings with employees, answering massive amounts of email, or keeping up with Twitter feeds, their success ultimately depends on their strategic communication skills. The first book to offer a strategic approach to managerial communication in health care, Beyond Persuasion is full of valuable information on issues such as how to develop fundamental skills, communicate strategically with internal groups such as employees and medical staff, and develop relationships with the external community and both traditional and new media.In this new edition, Patricia J. Parsons has added new references and resources and has updated the text with fresh material on how to weave social media tools, tactics, strategies, and policies into the fundamental discussion about communication as a personal, professional, and organizational priority.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

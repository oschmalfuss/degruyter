In 2004, Indonesia had a second democratic election which was also conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner. With 24 political parties, more than half a million polling stations and 150 million eligible voters, the Indonesian election in 2004 was probably one of the largest single-day electoral events in human history. Indeed, it is significant that Indonesia -- the country with the world’s largest number of Muslims -- has taken major steps towards consolidation of democratic institutions. The notion of citizenry participation has begun to take root. This book discusses Indonesia’s transition towards democracy through the parliamentary and presidential elections, including an analysis of party activity in the provinces, in 2004. The country still has some distance to travel along the road to democracy. But in the words of the new President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, ”What I promised the Indonesian voters was quite simple: to do my best to make Indonesia more democratic, more peaceful, more just, more prosperous. And I intend to keep that promise.” (Singapore, 16 February 2005)  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

French, British, Spanish, and Russian rulers have at times claimed parts of its land, and in independence Canada has come to embrace thirteen separate governments -- federal, provincial, and territorial. Now for the first time the record of that past has been captured in the words of images of heraldry. This is a pioneer study, the only complete account of the evolution of the arms, seals, and the official flags of canada from the time of discovery to the present. It is both an historical discussion and a guide to current practice. Forty-six illustrations in full colour and 189 in black of white faithfully reproduce the armorial bearings and complement the text. The author writes with unique authority as the first Canadian member of the College of Arms. The basic function of arms is indentification: the arms of sovereign authorities -- known technically as the arms of dominion and sovereignty -- are borne to demonstrate authority and jurisdiction. In his opening chapters Dr. Swan discusses the general principles involved and the relevant arms and seals of the kings and queens of France and England: he explains how they changed and were used to express sovereign authority in the new world. Chapters follow on the arms, seals, and flags of the sovereign state of Canada, with separate chapters on each province and the territories, all with an abundance of historical anecdotes. In his commentary, Dr. Swan provides not only the proper heraldic blazons, but also plainer descriptions of arms and seals for the general reader. He has prepared as well a glossary of heraldic terms used in this book. Appendixes discuss royal style and title, the privy seals of the Governors General of Canada, and the arms and seals of Spain and Russia. Canada: Symbols of Sovereignty is an important and fascinating introduction to the visible symbols of our life, historical and contemporary, for anyone with an interest in Canadian history or canadiana. For heraldists, historians, archivists, numismatists, and those interested in constitutional law, it provides an authoritative source of information.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

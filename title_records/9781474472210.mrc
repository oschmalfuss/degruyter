This study focuses on the post-Holocaust writers Sylvia Plath, Geoffrey Hill, Tony Harrison and Ted Hughes, while also stressing the links between them and the Holocaust poetry of Paul Celan, Miklós Radnóti, Primo Levi and János Pilinszky.Developing his theory of 'awkwardness' Antony Rowland argues that post-Holocaust poetry can play an important part in our understanding of Holocaust writing by stressing its self-conscious, imaginative engagement with the Holocaust, as well as the literature of survivors. The book illustrates that 'awkward' poetics enable post-Holocaust poets to provide ethical responses to history, and avoid aesthetic prurience. This probing and sensitive reassessment of Holocaust-related poetry will appeal to academics and students working in the areas of Holocaust Studies, contemporary poetry, and twentieth-century literature in general.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

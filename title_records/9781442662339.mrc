The authors also examine the impact of digital technology on medical education in office-based settings and provide tips on working with the new generation of learners who enjoy - and expect - instant access to information of all kinds.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

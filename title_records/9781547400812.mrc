It is meant to introduce you to the terms and technologies that you need to know to be successful in business and jobs related to technology. This unusual book was designed to teach a motivated reader about hundreds of technologies and business processes that are important today if you want to succeed. Its goal is to give you a broad understanding of an amazing array of topics. This book is a preparation for life in business today. It’s not an encyclopedia, but it is arranged to make digesting this information as efficient and effective as possible. It caters to two audiences: those who need to know the basics of technology and business to get a high paying job and those who need to know about technology to do their job more effectively, especially as managers. It is not too deep, but covers a broad spectrum of content that you may need to know. As such, it is a starting point for more investigation if a specific area is of interest. It is the perfect book for someone planning to become a programmer or IT specialist who does not yet have the proper background. For managers, it addresses the topics you need to know to talk intelligently to your IT staff and programmers, to vendors and to designers. You will learn the basics of hundreds of technologies that impact business today. If you are just looking to begin or change a career or going to college and you want a broad understanding or what can be expected of you when you are faced with getting a job or will want to learn at school, then that is the role of this book. As people have turned to the internet as their primary source of information, this has led to major gaps in the knowledge of workers at all levels. You have to know what you need to know to be able to learn what you need to know. If you know specifically what you are looking for and are not too worried about detail, then searching online or watching YouTube videos can be a quick solution. But, if you want to learn to program, go into any technical profession or learn what you need to know to be a manager today, then the internet is a poor solution. We are inefficient time-wasting learners and will burn massive amounts of time searching the net for piecemeal information. Need-to-know Technologies for a Successful Future is the solution to this problem. Jim Keogh, an assistant professor at New York University and a faculty member at Saint Peter’s University in Jersey City, New Jersey, as well as a former faculty member and chair of the e-commerce track of study at Columbia University, delves into the technological knowledge you must have to get a job or advance in your career including understanding computer technology, artificial intelligence, the Cloud, and new horizons in integrated computer technology. .  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 25.

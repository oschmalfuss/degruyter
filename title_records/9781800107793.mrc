Amongst the survivals are the last twenty-one years of the accounts of the Luton Guild of the Holy Trinity, hitherto unpublished in full.The accounts record several hundred transactions each year, including rents for the guild's properties, and expenditure on wages to priests and clerks and dirges sung for deceased members of the guild. Purchases of food, the cost of hiring cooks, kitchen helpers and utensils and expenditure on entertainment show what extraordinarily lavish provision was made for the annual feast. The quantity of building materials which was purchased for the guild`s properties suggests not only repairs but also modernisation and may be sufficient to attempt to reconstruct some of the houses.The majority of `brothers and systers` of the guild were drawn from a radius of about twenty-five miles of Luton and included the towns and villages in neighbouring Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. A small, but noticeable, group were from London, Canterbury, Boston and Kendal. The guild was prosperous, well-connected and active, and its accounts provide an insight into daily life in mid-sixteenth-century south Bedfordshire and the surrounding area.The book contains a complete transcription of the accounts and an introduction presenting an overview of the guild`s activities. It is fully indexed.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

In this book, distinguished scholars discuss recent innovations-charter schools, contracting arrangements, and choice-designed to liberate educators from burdensome bureaucratic controls and improve the level of opportunity for all children.Focusing on the problems in cities, where far too many children have been denied access to quality institutions, the authors examine the lessons to be learned from Catholic schools, site-based management, private entrepreneurs, and specific developments in three cities-New York, Milwaukee, and Chicago. The authors, though realistic about the political and institutional obstacles that stand in the way of meaningful change, foresee the demise of the "one size fits all" approach to schooling. They envision a system of schools that is dynamic, diverse, performance based, and accountable; one that is supportive of professionals, responsive to creativity, intolerant of failure, and committed to high educational standards for all children.Contributors:Louann BierleinAnthony BrykJohn ChubbChester FinnPaul HillValerie LeePaul PetersonDiane RavitchJoseph P.

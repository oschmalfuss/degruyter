Writers featured include Hugh MacDiarmid, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, Neil M. Gunn, Edwin and Willa Muir, Catherine Carswell, Sydney Goodsir Smith and Sorley MacLean.Key FeaturesThe first study of a Scottish modernism extending in its impact to the 1950s and drawing on influences from British and European modernismOriginal perspectives on the literature of the period through discussion of a range of writers and writing genresDetailed consideration of the work of women writers in the context of modernism and in their response to social changeA contribution to the expansion of the idea of modernism in its focus both on the modernist artist's role in social and national renewal and on writing from the peripheries of small town, rural and island cultures in contrast to metropolitan culture  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

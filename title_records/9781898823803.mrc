Originally published as a two-volume work in 1880, this later abridged version, first published in 1885 and promoted as ‘a tale of travel and adventure’, became one of the best-selling travel books published by John Murray; it was reprinted numerous times and by different publishers. This volume is the original 1885 edition. It is not a facsimile, but has been reprocessed digitally to enable the annotations to be inserted, as well as the 40 copperplate illustrations to be restored to their original quality. The commentaries and notes have been written by Kiyonori Kanasaka, Japan’s leading expert on Isabella Bird who, over the past nearly 30 years, has retraced Isabella Bird’s footsteps in all the parts of the world she visited, and knows her travels in Japan intimately. (See Isabella Bird and Japan: A Reassessment›, Renaissance Books 2017.) This book will be essential reading for all those interested in the Bird legacy, the birth of modern Japan, travel writings of the Far East, the topography of Japan and Japan’s social and political history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

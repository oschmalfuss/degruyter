Today, the world believes that Century has arrived. Yet from China's slumping economy to war clouds over the South China Sea and from environmental devastation to demographic crisis, Asia's future is increasingly uncertain. Historian and geopolitical expert Michael Auslin argues that far from being a cohesive powerhouse, Asia is a fractured region threatened by stagnation and instability. Here, he provides a comprehensive account of the economic, military, political, and demographic risks that bedevil half of our world, arguing that Asia, working with the United States, has a unique opportunity to avert catastrophe - but only if it acts boldly. Bringing together firsthand observations and decades of research, Auslin's provocative reassessment of Asia's future will be a must†'read for industry and investors, as well as politicians and scholars, for years to come.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

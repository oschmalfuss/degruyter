These data have illuminated traffic phenomena like breakdowns, oscillations, and hysteresis. However, despite these strides, the intricate nature of traffic flow and its underlying mechanisms remain subjects of ongoing debate and incomplete comprehension. Robert Herman, the pioneering figure in transportation science, firmly believed in the experimental essence of traffic theory. Unlike conventional practices of collecting limited traffic flow data, conducting traffic experiments empowers control of flow composition and rate, minimizes interference from complex variables, and facilitates the discovery of fundamental characteristics and mechanisms of traffic flow. In alignment with Herman’s conviction, the authors of this book undertook a series of experimental and modeling studies to delve into the intricacies of traffic flow evolution through the lens of car-following dynamics. Rooted in systems science and engineering theory, this book commences with experimental exploration of traffic flow. Employing methods to unearth individual decision-making mechanisms, the evolutionary patterns of group behavior, and their interconnectedness, theoretical models are employed to bridge micro-mechanisms with macro-phenomena. This approach introduces innovative ideas and methods, fostering the refined development of urban traffic behavior and management theory. It makes vital contributions in unraveling driver behavior and the evolution of road traffic flow, transcending conventional theories, and addressing globally recognized transportation challenges. Ultimately, it plays a pivotal role in advancing modern traffic flow theory that aligns with real-world complexities.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

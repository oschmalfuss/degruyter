The first of the interviews was recorded in 1985 with %9;OB commander Marek Edelman, and the last another conversation with him from 2000. Grupińska's other interlocutors are also %9;OB veterans-rank-and-file soldiers, men and women. They relate the stories of their homes and backgrounds-some were Bundists, others from Zionist or religious families-followed by their recollections of how they experienced and remembered the uprising. This provides several unique perspectives on shared episodes. Images include portraits of Grupińska's interlocutors, as well as never previously published photographs of the ghetto and its surroundings that are reminiscent of postcards.The second part of the book, "Rereading the List," is intended to function like a litany of the names of the %9;OB members who fought in the Warsaw ghetto uprising. This list was compiled by a group of fighters in 1943 and rediscovered by the author in 2000. Each name is accompanied by a short story about the fighter-sometimes only a sentence or two-as well as any available photograph of them. The list is followed by a reconstruction of the %9;OB army, its divisions, and the places they fought.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

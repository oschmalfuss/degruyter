For some, Dewey's contextualism remains intact, requiring more to be amended than radically changed. For others, his work needs significant revision if he is to be relevant in the new millennium. Finally, there are those who argue that we should not be so quick to pass Dewey by, for he has much to offer that has still gone unnoticed or unappreciated. This rich narrative indicates both where the context has changed and what needs to be preserved and nurtured in Dewey as we advance into the future.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

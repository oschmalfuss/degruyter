Written for everyone seriously interested in education, whether specialist or general reader, this volume provides an analysis and overview of the key issues that have arisen in education in the last decade and evaluates the prospects for formal education in the future. Among the topics Professor Fleming discusses in detail in this volume are the role of formal education, the expansion of the educational system, the quest for organizational efficiency, the relationship between the province and the universities, educational agencies outside the formal system, research and development, the financing of education, and the questions of religion and language. Education: Ontario's Preoccupation is indispensable as an introduction to the series ONTARIO'S EDUCATIVE SOCIETY, and provides in one volume a compendium of facts and analysis of the main issues in the province's educational development.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

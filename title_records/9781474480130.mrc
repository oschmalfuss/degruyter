Tina Röck transcends this understanding to explore the realistic potential of relational and dynamic ontology. These explorations are both complex and problematic as we attempt to reconceptualise being, truth and knowledge as processual.To navigate this thinking, Röck takes a new phenomenological path into a realism that discloses the world as temporal and relational, without dismissing the epistemological difficulties surrounding genuine change. A fundamental challenge to outdated ways of thinking in our rapid, interconnected world, this book provides a provocative and contemporary understanding of our temporal reality.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

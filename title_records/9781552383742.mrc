Noel Lyon does not believe that they are and maintains that current legal education is not in the public interest. With over thirty years experience in the legal field, Lyon passionately challenges the status quo. Inside Law School: Two Dialogues about Legal Education aims to provoke discussion on the future of legal education, particularly in relation to important topical issues such as environmental degradation and women's rights, which are not yet part of mainstream legal education. Using easy-to-read parallel dialogues between two law professors and two law students to present his ideas and points of view, Lyon clearly shows the existence of two law school cultures and lays the foundation for productive debate and reform. This book will be of interest not only to law professors and law students but also to practising lawyers, especially those governing the legal profession. Those outside the law profession who are discontent with our legal system and the role of lawyers in it will also find it captivating reading.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

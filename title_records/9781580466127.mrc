He was a member of one of the first graduating classes of the University of Rochester Medical School, and went on to a distinguished career at Columbia University, New York University, and St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. This autobiography tells of his experiences as an Italian-American who overcame prejudices to become the personal physician to such notablesas Greta Garbo and President Herbert Hoover. His story is witty and cleverly written, and details the way the medical profession changed from the Great Depression to the late 1990s.

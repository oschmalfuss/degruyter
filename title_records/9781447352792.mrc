Written by two experienced social researchers and trainers, this book provides a practical and concise introductory guide to doing research with children and young people, outlining the benefits and challenges along with key ethical, methodological and other considerations. Throughout, there are practical examples, checklists and top tips to aid the reader. Building on an established SRA training course, it offers an instructive resource for researchers, commissioners, policy makers, research users and others involved in research with children or young people.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

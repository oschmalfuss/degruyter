Information security incidents do not just affect small businesses, major companies and government departments suffer from them as well. Completely up to date with ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Managing Information Security Breaches sets out a strategic framework for handling this kind of emergency. The book provides a general discussion and education about information security breaches, how they can be treated and what ISO 27001 can offer in that regard, spiced with a number of real-life stories of information security incidents and breaches. These case studies enable an in-depth analysis of the situations companies face in real life, and contain valuable lessons that your organisation can learn from when putting appropriate measures in place to prevent a breach. Understand what your top information security priorities should be The author explains what your top priorities should be the moment you realise a breach has occurred, making this book essential reading for IT security managers, chief security officers, chief information officers and chief executive officers. It will also be of use to personnel in non-IT roles, in an effort to make this unwieldy subject more comprehensible to those who, in a worst-case scenario, will be on the receiving end of requests for six- or seven-figure excess budgets to cope with severe incidents. About the author Michael Krausz studied physics, computer science and law at the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna University and Webster University. Over the last 20 years he has become an accomplished professional investigator, IT expert and ISO 27001 auditor, investigating over a hundred cases of information security breaches.

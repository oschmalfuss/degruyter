Using his experience as director of land claims for the Métis Association of Alberta, Joe Sawchuk explains how these Aboriginal organizations began, how they set their political agendas, and how they are influenced by government funding and internal politics. The record of Native political organizations in Canada has been impressive, yet questions remain if government agendas blunts their effectiveness, and how decreases in funding might affect them in the future.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

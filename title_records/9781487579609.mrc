It describes, analyses and explains the recorded attitudes in that period to poverty as a social phenomenon. The focus of the study is the Poor Law, the network of law and practice which in the network of law and practice which in the two hundred years since its inception had become entwined in the fabric of society and of the economic system. In the early nineteenth century the Poor Law become one of the chief public issues of the day, the object of vigorous attack and the centre of controversy in which new assumptions of social order challenged old. The debate ranged far and wide and became involved with most of the other disputed issues of the time. The present work shows how, in 1834, the system was subjected to drastic changes in accordance with the new creed on poverty and its relief which had emerged in debate and was to continue as social orthodoxy until well into the twentieth century. The study is especially valuable in that, by an examination of contemporary writings, it leads to a proper understanding of the period, its preoccupations and concerns, such as can be gained only from the consideration of the thoughts and actions of those who belonged to it.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

It includes 49 separate experiments on electricity, magnetism, currents, voltage, generators, transformers, relays, alternators, resistance, gaps, and more. Each experiment covers: the object, method, result, and questions with answers on the experiment under discussion. A separate chapter at the end of the book has over 175 questions with answers to test your knowledge of electricity and electronics.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

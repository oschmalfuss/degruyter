It is unique in its importance for Islamic history: focusing upon the central Syrian city of Hims, it gives us a picture of the personalities of the city, the tribal conflicts within, the tensions between the proto-Muslim community and the majority Christian population, and above all details about the wars with the Byzantines. Additionally, Nu`aym gives us a range of both the Umayyad and the Abbasid official propaganda, which was couched in apocalyptic and messianic terms.Key FeaturesIncludes materials for Islamic military history: internal Muslim wars, the wars against the Byzantines, and the projected warfare of the Mahdi Presents fascinating social history, detailing earthquakes, plagues and appearances of cometsAlludes to the technological advances of the time: the use of water-wheels, the construction of ships and various methods of transportationGives a unique perspective on Syrian Muslim history with an extraordinary level of detail and richness of local perspective  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

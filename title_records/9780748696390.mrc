The Yes and No campaigns are well under way but with the vote looming closer the information available to the public is still limited. The Scottish people will have to make their own judgments, and so they need to have the issues explained as clearly as possible without spin or bias. What will happen after the referendum? How will Westminster and the rest of the UK respond? What happens if the vote is 'No'? Is it even clear what independence will mean? What about the oil? What will the currency be? What will happen to the Old Age Pension pot if the UK splits?Scotland’s Choices, now fully revised for the critical last few months before the referendum, does just that. Written by one former civil servant, one academic and one think-tanker – one a resident Scot, one a Scot living in England and one an Englishman – the authors clearly explain the issues you may not have considered and detail how each of the options would be put into place after the referendum.Key FeaturesLays out the facts in clear language with no political agendaWritten by leading experts at the heart of the political process who are equipped to ask hard questions about the optionsExplains the little-understood Scotland Act, which will come into force if the vote is NoLooks at the key issues that must be addressed if the vote is Yes: public spending, tax and welfare, EU membership, the future of Faslane, the currency, financial regulation, oil revenues and many others  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

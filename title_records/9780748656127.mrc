It traces the role of identity and interaction in the processes of acquiring new teaching skills and knowledge, reflecting on professional practice and constructing teaching selves, and explores the limits and constraints on these processes imposed by global forces such as the marketization of education. The book is written for teachers, teacher educators, postgraduate students and researchers interested in the relationships between social interaction, identity and professional practice in ELT. It is suitable for use in conjunction with any postgraduate-level course on language in interaction, as it surveys and critically discusses various approaches and includes many practical examples. Key features Includes a full survey of different approaches to the study of language teacher learning and identityProvides an introduction to a range of frameworks for analyzing talk and identity in teacher education and professional practice contexts Analyses spoken data from activities such as guided lesson-planning, post-teaching reflection, discussions of teaching materials Each chapter ends with practice tasks, discussion points, and references for further reading Suitable for use in conjunction with any postgraduate-level course on language in interaction, as it surveys and critically discusses various approaches and includes many practical examples  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

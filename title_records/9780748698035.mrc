Discourses of Regulation and Resistance explores this ambivalent and contradictory attitude to the West and employs in depth analysis of archive material to offer a comprehensive study of the censorship of translated literature in the Soviet Union.Detailed case studies from two of the most important Soviet literary journals, examine how editors and the authorities mediated and manipulated the image of the West, tracing debates and interventions in the publication process. Drawing upon material from Soviet archives, it shows how editors and translators tried to negotiate between their own ideals and the demands of Soviet ideology, combining censorship and resistance in a complex interplay of practices.As part of a new and growing body of work on translation as a cultural phenomenon, this book will make essential reading for students and scholars working in Translation Studies as well as cultural historians of Russia and the Soviet Union.Views Soviet censorship through the lens of contemporary Western theoriesFeatures detailed case studies drawn from two major journals, Internatsional'naia literature and Inostrannaia literaturaAnalyses archive material including translators' typescript, internal reviews and correspondence between journals and the Party  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

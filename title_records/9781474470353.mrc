These are presented in five sections:Language and the MediaLanguage and OrganisationsLanguage and GenderLanguage and YouthMultilingualism, Identity and EthnicityThis volume examines the overlapping areas of evaluation and assessment, where 'evaluation' is defined as the systematic use of information to make decisions about language teaching programmes and 'assessment' as the systematic use of information to make decisions about individuals and their language ability. A variety of topics are covered, including paradigms and purposes, design techniques, quantitative and qualitative methods for collecting and analysing data, and ethical, social and political considerations in the conduct of evaluation and assessment.The book has two important goals: to underscore the relationships between the enterprises of evaluation and assessment, and to encourage the use of new paradigms in our approaches to these enterprises.Key FeaturesThe first treatment of assessment and evaluation in one volumeExercises and suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapterIncludes an extensive bibliography."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Omar Khalifah’s analysis of these representations focuses on how the historical character of Nasser has emerged in the Egyptian imaginary. He explores the recurrent images of Nasser in literature and film and shows how Nasser constitutes a perfect site for plural interpretations. He argues that Nasser has become a rhetorical device, a figure of speech, a trope that connotes specific images constantly invoked whenever he is mentioned. His study makes a case for literature and art to be seen as alternative archives that question, erase, distort and add to the official history of Nasser.Key FeaturesContributes to the ongoing debate on Nasser and his relevance to modern EgyptiansTraces, contextualizes, and analyses the making of Nasser’s image(s) in creative productions including novels, short stories, autobiographies and filmShows how Nasser functions for many Egyptians as a site of memory at times disconnected from the real historical figure he once was  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

Dean Oliver examines the organization and administration of the return of Canadian soldiers from Europe after VE-Day, and Don Ives examines the philosophy and program of the Veterans Charter. Focusing on specific benefits of the Charter, Michael Stevenson looks at issues surrounding veterans' right to reinstatement in civil employment, Peter Neary deals with educational benefits made available through the Veterans Rehabilitation Act of 1945, and Terry Copp and Mary Tremblay examine rehabilitation of veterans with psychiatric and physical disabilities. Taking a broader scope, James Struthers provides an insightful assessment of the construction of the Canadian welfare state and Doug Owram offers a revisionist appraisal of Canadian society in the postwar era. J.L. Granatstein concludes the volume with a probing reflection on the meaning for Canadians of the veteran experience and of their country's participation in World War II. The achievements of this generation of Canadian soldiers are sometimes downplayed; this collection of essays puts their achievements on the historical record and pays tribute to their memory and accomplishments.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

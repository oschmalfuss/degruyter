Agatha Schwartz analyses the connections between the women's movements and women's writing in Austria and Hungary to explore some differences between works written in Austria and those coming from Hungary, whose urban culture was younger. She provides critiques of major works of fiction and theory by authors such as Rosa Mayreder, Grete Meisel-Hess, Margit Kaffka and Szikra.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

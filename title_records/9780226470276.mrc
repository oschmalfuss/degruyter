It isn't the squeak of sneakers or the crunch of helmets; it isn't the grunts or even the stadium music. It's the deafening roar of sports fans. For those few among us on the outside, sports fandom-with its war paint and pennants, its pricey cable TV packages and esoteric stats reeled off like code-looks highly irrational, entertainment gone overboard. But as Erin C. Tarver demonstrates in this book, sports fandom has become extraordinarily important to our psyche, a matter of the very essence of who we are.             Why in the world, Tarver asks, would anyone care about how well a total stranger can throw a ball, or hit one with a bat, or toss one through a hoop? Because such activities and the massive public events that surround them form some of the most meaningful ritual identity practices we have today. They are a primary way we-as individuals and a collective-decide both who we are who we are not. And as such, they are also one of the key ways that various social structures-such as race and gender hierarchies-are sustained, lending a dark side to the joys of being a sports fan. Drawing on everything from philosophy to sociology to sports history, she offers a profound exploration of the significance of sports in contemporary life, showing us just how high the stakes of the game are.    aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 22.

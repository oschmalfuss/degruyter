How did they avoid feelings of guilt for the many atrocities their side committed? David A. Harrisville compellingly demonstrates that this myth was created during the course of the war itself; it was not a postwar whitewashing of events. In 1941, three million Wehrmacht troops overran the border between German- and Soviet-occupied Poland, racing towards the USSR in the largest military operation in modern history. Over the next four years, they embarked on a campaign of wanton brutality, murdering countless civilians, systemically starving millions of Soviet POWs, and actively participating in the genocide of Eastern European Jews. After the war, however, German servicemen insisted that they had fought honorably and their institution had never involved itself in Nazi crimes. Drawing on over two thousand letters from German soldiers, contextualized by operational and home front documents, Harrisville shows that this myth was the culmination of a long-running efforts by the army to preserve an image of respectability in the midst of a criminal operation. Ordinary soldiers were the primary authors of this fabrication, cultivating a decent self-image and developing moral arguments to explain their behavior by drawing on a constellation of values that long preceded Nazism. The Virtuous Wehrmacht explains how the army encouraged troops to view themselves as honorable representatives of a civilized nation, not only racially but morally superior to others  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

Advocating a principled approach to the creation of materials, it combines an awareness of relevant language learning and teaching theory with a critical attitude to existing published materials. It also encourages critical reflection by demonstrating how choices need to be informed by an awareness of culture, context and purpose.Material Development in TESOL’s stimulating approach, with thought-provoking, interactive tasks, online resources, and added perspectives from international research, makes it an ideal textbook for language teacher programmes around the world, equipping TESOL student teachers and practicing teachers with the frameworks, resources and practical skills necessary to carry out effective evaluations and to develop principled materials in practice.Written specifically for TESOL practitioners and those studying TESOL teachingAccessible presentation of concepts and research Accompanying website provides additional online resources and materialsInteractive tasks and further reading suggestions Encourages students to critically reflect on their choices of materials  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

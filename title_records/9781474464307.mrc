The concept of Ecologism starts from the position that the non-human world is worthy of moral consideration and that this should be taken into account in the ordering of social, economic and political systems. It is recognised as a major development in Environmental Politics and, increasingly, as a significant alternative to existing political philosophies.The book provides a comprehensive and systematic survey of the main components of Ecologism, and examines elements which have been neglected in the existing literature. Written in a clear and approachable style, it covers both the current debates surrounding this key aspect of environmental political philosophy and the author's own development of these debates.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

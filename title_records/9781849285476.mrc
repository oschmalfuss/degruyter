IT is integral to modern organisations, and the way you manage it can make or break your business. IT service management - not just for the IT director It is not enough for the IT manager to understand the latest technical developments. For your company to succeed, everyone in the IT department must also understand their role in achieving overall business goals. IT service management questions answered Written in a friendly question-and-answer format, Practical ITSM explains how to set up a technical service management structure, using the best practice framework established by the latest version of the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL® 2011). ITIL framework for structured ITSM The ITIL system is the most widely adopted approach to technical IT service management worldwide. It shows technical support staff how to provide the efficient IT services that are vital to your company’s success. Learn how ITIL can help you to: Protect your company’s reputation If you system goes down for any length of time, you might not be able to process an order or honour a contract. ITSM helps your business meet customer deadlines and expectations. Safeguard vital information and recover from IT setbacks Without adequate IT service management you could risk losing vital information, like payroll, billing and sales data. Retain momentum With a structured IT service management in place, routine maintenance issues can be quickly resolved, minimising delays and improving productivity. Read this book to see how ITIL can help your IT function support business goals.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

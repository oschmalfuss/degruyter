In many situations, we act without fully considering why we are behaving in a certain way. We like to feel good about ourselves; we interpret the world using stories instead of statistics; and we make instinctive judgments and then stick to them. How can we think more clearly and make better decisions—in business and in life?This book is a practical and accessible introduction to mental models, teaching readers how to harness their power to think more clearly, make better decisions, and learn more effectively. The essential step in applying these concepts and frameworks, Jaime Lester shows, is to pause. Take a moment to reflect on the options, decide on the optimal approach before launching into action, and reexamine the process regularly. Drawing on a variety of academic disciplines as well as cognitive and behavioral research, Lester offers step-by-step templates to improve readers’ critical thinking and decision making. He guides readers through honing their reasoning in areas including finance, economics, statistics, and daily life and draws broader lessons for cultivating a prudent investment approach as well as personal well-being and happiness. Written in a conversational and witty style and featuring memorable examples and illustrations, Pause to Think shares essential lessons and tools for all readers interested in the power of mental models.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

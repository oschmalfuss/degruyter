The history of relations between England and Scotland is always passionate and often controversial. What is extraordinary is that the pervasive spread and influence of English migration north of the Border has been largely ignored until now.Using a range of different sources including oral history contributions from English people living all over Scotland, Murray Watson explores how the English merged into and contributed to Scottish society in the second half of the twentieth century. Many of the myths surrounding the English in Scotland are dispelled and what emerges instead is that the migratory experience has been extremely complex and multi-faceted in nature. The near-invisible absorption of so many English-born migrants has far-reaching implications for the host communities at a local, regional and national level, as well as influencing Scotland's economy, its demography, culture and society.At a political and constitutional level, after a number of false starts, Scotland has gained some measure of devolved autonomy. And here, English migrants have shown a range of fascinating responses in the reconstruction of their own identities. In leaving behind the undoubted insecurities and uncertainties about what it means to be English, their reactions to moving to a country with strong traditions of national feeling has been intriguing and surprising.The first comprehensive exploration of the complex process of English migration into Scotland, Being English in Scotland challenges us with as many questions as answers.Key FeaturesThe first full-scale coverage of the English in Scotland - Scotland's largest migrant group (over 366,000 English-born adults live in Scotland).Challenges many of the commonly-held assumptions and myths about the English in Scotland.Explores findings about racism and the construction of national identities."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Yet the gender impact of expanding private pension provision and relying increasingly on means-testing has been largely overlooked. This book examines key issues such as: how pension choices over the lifecourse are structured by gender, class and ethnicity; the impact of changing patterns of partnership and parenthood on pension building; the distributional impact of privatising pensions; questions about individualisation of rights, survivor benefits, a citizen's pension and means-testing; the EU dimension - comparing alternative strategies for improving gender equity. The book is essential reading for teachers, researchers and students in social gerontology, sociology, social policy and women's studies; practitioners in social work and welfare rights; policy makers concerned with income in later life; and all those who wish to improve their understanding of pensions issues.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

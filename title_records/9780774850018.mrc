She focuses on debates, public inquiries, and policy evolution during the Trudeau, Mulroney, and Chr�tien eras, contextualizing these developments with a discussion of the changing patterns of women's employment since the Second World War. Drawing on a wealth of interviews and close analysis of primary documents, Driven Apart explains why federal governments have been able to implement employment equity policies but have failed to develop a national system of child care. Driven Apart was selected as an Outstanding Academic Title by CHOICE and was awarded The Pierre Savard Prize by the International Council for Canadian Studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

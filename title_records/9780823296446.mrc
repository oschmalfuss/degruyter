This volume provides the reader with an overview of the main trends and dilemmas that have dominated discussions on the complex Joyce/Beckett relationship, and pulls together previously scattered materials into a cohesive whole. It also contains an extensive bibliography of particular interest to scholars who will find this composite of sources priceless. The main section offers eleven engaging new essays written from many points of view on a variety of topics including, the impact of biographies written on both Joyce and Beckett, the handling of Irish materials in the short story form, the use of allusion as well as larger narrative structures, the portrayal of the concept of the artist, and the way in which each author deals with the problem of "authority" in their writings. An original one-act play by Denis Regan is also included; the play premiered in April 1990 at the Milwaukee Irishfest. This work does much to challenge previous misconceptions about the Joyce/Beckett relationship. Re: Joyce 'n Beckett is a rich, lively work that brings the relationship of these two, crucially important literary figures of the twentieth century together in one definitive volume.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 17.

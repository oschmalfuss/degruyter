The Other Side of Glamour is a study of the historical development of the left-wing film establishment in Hong Kong. The interplay between the macro-politics of the Cold War and the micro-politics of a regionalised/localised ideological warfare lends itself to a critical mapping of the general contours of the ‘cultural Cold War’ between the KMT and the CCP as it materialised in the so-called ‘left–right divide’ in the filmmaking world. Using the major studios as the main axis of analysis, this study traces the footprints of other collaborating cultural agents which made up the left-wing film network in Hong Kong. It argues that the left-wing’s institutional character and corporate strategies in the making of a ‘popular left-wing cinema’ are indispensable to an understanding of their nuanced legacy in Hong Kong cinema today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

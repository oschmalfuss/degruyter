It is one of a few systematically comparative social science analyses of such national health systems as Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Based on a total of 2500 cases the project analyses problems like health culture, social stratification in its impact on health, health life style and the motivations of people that shape health policies. This book meets both the expectation of descriptive information as well as comprehensive analysis by statistical means and on the background of practical as well as theoretical concerns. The policy implications of the results are eminent. The comparative design is of exemplary importance for health and social science. The book is of interest for public health, health professionals, health policymakers, psychologists, social scientists and political representatives from the community up to the European level.

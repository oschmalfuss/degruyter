What new practices and processes are emerging within the contemporary UK filmmaking landscape? What impact is this having upon filmmaking professionals?The business of conventional feature filmmaking is like no other, in that it assembles a huge company of people from a range of disciplines on a temporary basis, all to engage in the collaborative endeavour of producing a unique, one-off piece of work. By focusing on the pivotal year of 2012, and by considering the input of every single contributor to the process, this book illuminates how this period of analogue to digital transition is impacting upon working practices, cultures, opportunities and structures in the industry, and examines the various causative forces behind their adoptions and resistances. With an in-depth case study of Sally Potter’s 2012 film Ginger & Rosa, and drawing upon interviews with international film industry practitioners, From Film Practice to Data Process is a groundbreaking examination of film production in its totality, in a moment of profound change.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

A quarrel with Lockhart, however, put a stop to the project, and nothing more was heard of it until the recent discovery of an autograph manuscript, here edited and published for the first time. A well-written and carefully-researched narrative, it increases our knowledge of Scott's life and work as perceived by his contemporaries, as well as enabling us to read Hogg's Anecdotes in their original context. The editor's introduction draws extensively on uncollected and unpublished material to illuminate Macrone's career, in the course of which he became the friend and publisher of Dickens, Thackeray, and Moore.Key FeaturesThe first publication of a manuscript which was believed to be lostProvides a hitherto unknown contemporary perspective on Sir Walter Scott's life and workIncludes an introduction by the editor and a specially commissioned essay by Gillian Hughes giving a detailed account of Macrone’s career based largely on uncollected or unpublished materialEstablishes a new context for James Hogg's Anecdotes of Scott  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

To speak of ecologies of architecture is to break with judgement for experience. As Gilles Deleuze put it in his book on Nietzsche, it is not about justification, ‘but a different way of feeling: another sensibility’. If to think differently we have to feel differently, then the design of the built environment has no other purpose but to transform us. While engineering is solution-oriented, architecture stays with the problem so as to tease out a creative potential.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

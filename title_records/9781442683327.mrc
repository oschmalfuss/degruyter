How does a government work against its stated objectives? How do ghettos appear in the middle of a pristine wilderness?They found that, starting in the early '60s, as government involvement in band life increased, dependency on the government also increased - to the point where today government programs provide 90 percent of the band members' income.Now dependent on programs with can be curtailed at the governments' will, the band is in an extremely vulnerable position. The authors suggest that this is also true of other bands across the country and offer suggestions for constructive change.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

It treats the subject from a sound physiological and medical point of view, and provides a careful synthesis of knowledge in this complex area. This second edition has been completely rewritten, to reflect recent advances in the field. It presents a thorough historical review as well as analyses of topics such as the importance of cardio-respiratory fitness and techniques for its measurement, the problem of factors limiting oxygen transfer, over-nutrition, obesity, muscular development, and the influence of tobacco, drugs, and alcohol in fitness. The author discusses the role of physical activity in the prevention and treatment of disease (particularly cardiovascular disease), and points out the economic costs both of being unfit and of promoting good health. Dr. Shepard has drawn upon his considerable experience as a member of national and international organizations concerned with physical activity, as director of the Fitness Research Unit at the University of Toronto and as a teacher of graduate and undergraduate courses in Exercise Physiology.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

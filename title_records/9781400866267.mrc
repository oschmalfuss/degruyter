This new edition of Development Macroeconomics has been fully revised to address the more open and less stable environment in which developing countries operate today.Describing the latest advances in this rapidly changing field, the book features expanded coverage of public debt and the management of capital inflows as well as new material on fiscal discipline, monetary policy regimes, currency, banking and sovereign debt crises, currency unions, and the choice of an exchange-rate regime. A new chapter on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models with financial frictions has been added to reflect how the financial crisis has reshaped our thinking on the role of such frictions in generating and propagating real and financial shocks. The book also discusses the role of macroprudential regulation, both independently and through its interactions with monetary policy, in preserving financial and macroeconomic stability.Now in its fourth edition, Development Macroeconomics remains the definitive textbook on the macroeconomics of developing countries.The most authoritative book on the subject-now fully revised and expandedFeatures new material on fiscal discipline, monetary policy regimes, currency, banking and sovereign debt crises, and much moreComes with online supplements on informal financial markets, stabilization programs, the solution of DSGE models with financial frictions, and exchange rate crises  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

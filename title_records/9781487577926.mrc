The ancient Greeks and Romans had at their disposal several mechanical water-lifting devices. The water-screw, the force pump, the compartmented wheel, and the bucket-chain were developed by scientists associated with the great school at Alexandria. Application of these devices was sporadic in the Hellenistic world, but they, and the later saqiya gear, were used in a wide range of rural and urban settings in many parts of the Roman Empire.Professor Oleson has prepared a definitive study of mechanical water-lifting devices in the Greek and Roman world. He systematically and thoroughly examines the literary, papyrological, and archaeological evidence for the devices and considers the design, materials, settings, costs, effectiveness, and durability of the many adaptations of the small basic repertoire of models. The literary and papyrological materials range from Deuteronomy to papyri of the seventh century AD, and the archaeological sites discussed range from Babylon to Wales.An extensive collection of illustrations complements the literary, papyrological, and archaeological evidence for this remarkable ancient technology.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

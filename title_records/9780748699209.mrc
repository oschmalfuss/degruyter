Studying films from various genres, the book examines their reception across four languages (Spanish, French, Catalan, English) and engages with participants across a range of digital and physical audience locations.With a particular focus on LGBTQ festivals and on issues relating to LGBTQ experience in both countries, Perriam and Waldron consider issues such as ageing, sense of community and isolation, and the representation of issues affecting trans people. Examining films that chronicle the local (in portraying national and sub-national identities) while also addressing foreign audiences, the book draws on a wide sample of individual responses through post-screening questionnaires and focus groups, as well as drawing on the work of professional film critics and on-line commentators.Key FeaturesThe first internationally comparative and crosscutting study of LGBTQ film, with audience research at its coreExamines LGBTQ festivals in France and SpainLooks at the cross-border impact of the auteur and big-name directorsExtensively covers independent and documentary film production as well as commercially-pitched feature films  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

It argues that conceptions of national religion were influential in the debates surrounding liturgical revision, showing in particular how ideas of Protestant national identity clashed with both liberal Anglican and moderate Anglo-Catholic conceptions of Church and nation. It shows how theChurch of England retained a significant position in national life in the interwar period; however, it also argues that the resilience of the anti-Catholic mindset amongst many Anglicans and Free Churchmen meant that the exact nature of the relationship between religion and nation was hotly contested. This study sets the Prayer Book controversy in the context of early twentieth century British religious history, providing important insights into the history of Anglicanism, Nonconformity and ideas of English and British identity during the period.

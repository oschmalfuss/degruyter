This first full-length study of Coryndon is neither a traditional gubernatorial biography of a favoured son of the imperial school nor an ideological history of colonial oppression. Instead Youé sets out to analyze Coryndon’s relationships with African rulers, white settlers, Indian traders, and metropolitan officials in order to assess the impact of his administrations on the territories he governed and to delineate the constraints on proconsular rule.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

It reappraises Crane’s poetry and reception and introduces several lost works by the poet, including critical prose, reviews and ‘Nopal’, a poem written in Mexico. Through its exploration of Crane’s close engagement with periodical culture, it provides a rich and detailed panorama of twentieth-century literary and artistic communities. In particular, this monograph offers a vivid portrait of forgotten periodicals and their artistic communities, examines the periodical contexts in which modernist poetry fused material and aesthetic experimentation and explores Crane’s important and neglected influence on modern and contemporary poetry.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

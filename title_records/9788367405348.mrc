This departure has two strands, because the practice that the Second Vatican Council critically addressed was a manualist tradition, while much of the practice following the Council has been represented as relativist. This book is not manualist in that the focus is upon method rather than on codified specification of behaviours. The work is not relativist in that the focus on method is firstly scriptural, approaching scripture in a holistic or canonical manner; and, further, is lawful, in an approach of law that focuses less on precept and more on understandings of natural law that brings together phenomenological evidences and scriptural evidences. The scriptural and natural law perspective present in the book also engages cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary learnings. These streams of scripture, natural law, and inter/cross-disciplinary learnings have a confluence in discourse in the manner of dialogue, a manner that is dialogical. An essential aspect of dialogue under the banner of Reconstructing Theological Ethics is that it should engage contemp -orary culture––not in a sense that contemporaneity or modernity should be determinative, but in the sense that the reasoning, argumentation, and dialogue should have resonance with contemporary thinking and rethinking of issues that remain in contention for contemporary audiences. Theological Ethics is a wide remit, and the book provides a methodological focus on Selected Topics in Human Sexuality.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

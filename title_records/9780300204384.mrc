While austerity-wracked southern states descend into misery and resentment, creditor countriesùled by Germanyùfear that they will be forced to subsidize their weaker brethren indefinitely. Constructive dialogue has collapsed as European decision making descends into terrified paralysis, and the potential paths out of the impasse are blocked by indecision and incompetence at the top.As voters in Greece and Italy rebel against externally imposed hardship, and the sums needed to bail out failed economies reach ever more staggering proportions, the contradictions at the heart of the European project are becoming more and more obvious. Marsh warns that the current succession of complex technical fixes cannot sustain the Eurozone on life support indefinitely. Radical solutions are on offer, but without leaders who are strong and principled enough to push them through, Europe risks a depressing future of permanent decline.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

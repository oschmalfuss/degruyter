With recollections that show the grit and improvisation of early Syrian pioneers, Arab Cooking on a Prairie Homestead demonstrates Salloum's love of traditional Arab cuisine. By growing "exotic" crops brought from their country of origin--such as lentils, chickpeas, and bulgur--the Salloums survived the Dust Bowl conditions of the 1930s, and helped change the landscape of Canadian farming. Over 200 recipes--from dumplings and lentil pies to zucchini mint soup--in this updated classic will provide today's foodies and urban farmers with dishes that are not only delicious, but also climate-friendly and gentle on your wallet!  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

His graduate study at Cornell University was interrupted by the Second World War, and he completed his Ph.D. studies at the University of California, Berkeley in 1948. Quoting the obituary written by Barry Stroud and Hans Sluga, Mates "made lasting contributions to philosophy, the history of philosophy, the history of logic, and the understanding of antiquity. His work was of the highest order: clear, precise, illuminating, thoroughly reliable, and always at the highest level of logical and philological expertise." His Stoic Logic, based on his Ph.D. thesis, "was one of the first works to open the way for serious study and proper appreciation of the Stoics as philosophers and logicians. Greater sophistication in mathematical logic made it possible for Benson to demonstrate clearly for the first time the intricate ways in which the logical ideas of the Stoics were well in advance of those of Aristotle and in many respects closer to our own. The book remains a landmark in both fields."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Aspects of property, intellectual property, contract, succession and probate, privacy and data protection, jurisdiction and criminal law are considered. Harbinja puts forward policy suggestions, proposals for law reforms and sets out an innovative agenda which will open new avenues for research. Her useful consideration of current digital legacy tools and technologies also offers practical advice for users when it comes to their own estate planning.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 05.

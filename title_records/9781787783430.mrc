The EU Commission, the Article 29 Working Party (now the EDPB (European Data Protection Board)), the EU Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, and Cloud-industry leaders have all contributed to its development, resulting in a robust framework that recognises the unique requirements of the Cloud industry. Cloud providers must ensure that their services – which by design involve accessing and transferring data across the Internet, exposing it to far greater risk than data stored and processed within an organisation’s internal network – meet or exceed the GDPR’s requirements in order to provide the security and privacy that the market expects. Organisations can achieve this via compliance with the EU Cloud Code of Conduct. The Code has already been adopted by major Cloud service organisations, including: Microsoft Oracle Salesforce IBM Google Cloud Dropbox Alibaba Cloud Public and business focus on information security and data protection continues to increase in the face of a constantly changing threat landscape and ever more stringent regulation, and compliance with initiatives such as the EU Cloud Code of Conduct demonstrates to current and potential customers that your organisation is taking data privacy seriously. It also strengthens your organisation’s approach to information security management, and defences against data breaches.    The EU Data Protection Code of Conduct for Cloud Service Providers provides guidance on how to implement the Code. It explores the Code’s objectives, and how compliance can be achieved with or without an ISMS (information security management system).

Yet, while ceaselessly invoked, this notorious device has received barely any detailed attention from the field of film studies.This book is the first in-depth examination of one of the most overused and under-analysed concepts in discussions of popular cinema. What exactly is the 'happy ending'? Is it simply a cliché, as commonly supposed? Why has it earned such an unenviable reputation? What does it, or can it, mean? Concentrating especially on conclusions featuring an ultimate romantic union – the final couple – this wide-ranging investigation probes traditional associations between the 'happy ending' and homogeneity, closure, ‘unrealism’, and ideological conservatism, testing widespread assumptions against the evidence offered by a range of classical and contemporary films.Key FeaturesDefines key features of the Hollywood ‘happy ending’ through detailed textual analysis and theoretical debateTraces the historical development of the scholarly approaches taken towards the cinematic ‘happy ending’Reassesses the concept of cinematic closure and its relationship to genre, ideology and ‘unrealism’  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

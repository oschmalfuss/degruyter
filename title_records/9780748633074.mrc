Rivers and other psychological writers of the early twentieth century, as well as contemporary theorists of nostalgia and trauma, this book examines the pathology of nostalgia conveyed in Sassoon's unpublished poems, letters and journals, together with his published work. It situates his ongoing anxiety about 'Englishness', modernity, and his relation to modernist aesthetics, within the context of other literary responses to the legacy of war, and the threat of war's return, by writers including Edmund Blunden, Robert Graves and T. E. Lawrence.Key FeaturesProvides the most thorough, eloquently crafted and focused revisionist study of Siegfried Sassoon to dateSets Sassoon's work in new contexts and offers Sassoon as a case study for new ways of remembering warTaps into current theories of trauma, nostalgia and memoryEstablishes continuities between the literary culture of the First and Second World Wars"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

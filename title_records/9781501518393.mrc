We will see our personal, social, professional, and business lives change just as dramatically as we experienced with the arrival of the personal computer, Internet, and smart phone. The book also discusses some of the most important metaverse technologies, concepts, and methods which are needed by organizational leaders to understand as they begin to map out their metaverse transformation plans. These discussions are followed by detailed chapters on the main elements of an effective enterprise transformation initiative, concluding with a detailed hypothetical case study that describes how such a transformation can be accomplished. The central purpose of the book is to help executives and other professionals in charting an effective course to the metaverse.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

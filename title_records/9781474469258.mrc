Gillian Hughes's uncovering of the original manuscript in the Fales Library of New York University in August 2001 allows the editors to produce here a text that reflects Hogg's original intentions.Alongside the two main plots (the supernatural located at Aikwood Castle and the chivalric located at Roxburgh Castle) a series of embedded narratives provides the reader with, amongst other things, pictures of the traditional and timeless world of rural life in which Hogg had grown up and of early Scottish history. The name Sir Walter Scott (used through most of the manuscript) is restored and passages excised from the manuscript or omitted when the printed edition was prepared are included in the editorial apparatus. In several cases Hogg's more daringly explicit language has been brought back where the printed edition has bowdlerised or subdued the expression. The restoration of the name in particular makes explicit how much this novel represents a challenge to Scott's dominance in the portrayal of chivalry and the Middle Ages in general. Any attempt to assess Hogg as a major novelist, and in particular as a major historical novelist, must consider this edition of The Three Perils of Man.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Yet most attempts at transformational change fail, hamstrung by poor strategy, office politics, stakeholder resistance, and the pressures of constant transformation.In Stragility, Ellen Auster and Lisa Hillenbrand provide a powerful, practical, action-oriented approach that equips leaders at all levels to navigate these challenges while building skills and capabilities for the next strategic change. Filled with great examples of leading edge companies, and jam-packed with concrete tips, action steps, and tools, Stragility offers indispensable advice on how to make continuous strategic changes, navigate the politics and emotions of change, and inspire and engage leaders and stakeholders.Building on a field-tested framework the authors have applied in Fortune 500 companies, small businesses, and social sector organizations, Stragility provides the tools for creating a thriving, high-energy organization that will excel at strategic change – again and again.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

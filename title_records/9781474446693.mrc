The legal mythologies undergirding these self-serving proposals are divided between doctrines of law’s immemorial nature, and of its sacred (Roman) origins. Thomas’s de-mythicised jurisprudence, presented in this collection of essays, dismisses these sagas. His work sent seismic waves across the humanities and social sciences, with claims including: Law is not a set of rules, but the operation of legal arguments; lawyers are the agents of the legal denaturalisation of the worldRome is misread as an essentially political entity; the effect exercised on Roman society by its jurists ranks before that of its politiciansDespite a widely accepted opposition between modern labour law and the Roman renting-out of a slave's workforce, there exist unexpected commonalities‘Legal order’ and ‘responsibility’ are among the inventions of modern law; they are not part of the timeless inventory of the world  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

Sharing a lifetime of experience of writing about art, making films and installations, as well as curating exhibitions, she shows us how these may be brought into dialogue with insights from theory.Bal teaches us how to think with images, but also how to write and think – as artists and writers – about our own creative work. This is Mieke Bal at her most personal and her best.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Taking these various challenges and opportunities of the past into account, how does the future look for Canada? In Reflecting on Our Past and Embracing Our Future diplomats, politicians, scientists, and human rights leaders including Phil Fontaine, Michaëlle Jean, Ellen Gabriel, Paul Heinbecker, Bob Rae, Jean Charest, and David Suzuki have come together to share their wisdom and experience of events that have marked the country over the last fifty years. Reflecting on the role of the Senate in Canada as complementary to the House of Commons, they consider central issues such as the condition of indigenous peoples, the obligations of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the recognition of two official languages, and the national unity referendums. Contributors also discuss the transformation of the economy in a globalized and digital world, the role of Canada on the world stage at a time of growing tension and an increasing flow of refugees, climate change and the uncertain future of the Arctic, scientific and cultural competitions on the international market, and the future of parliamentary democracy. Correcting misconceptions about the contemporary role of the Senate, and providing a counterargument for radical Senate reform, Reflecting on Our Past and Embracing Our Future offers rich perspectives and fascinating insights about Canada's likely development in the coming years.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Presented informally, it is filled with the vast learning and demonstrates the imaginative magnitude we have come to expect of this distinguished critic: the brilliant argument and the pleasantly witty presentation will inform and delight. The first four essays in the volume deal with Paradise Lost. Frye discusses the form and tradition of the epic, the rôle of the Son of God, a construction of the cosmology of the poem as a framework for its imagery, the reasons for Milton's presentation of the behaviour of Adam and Eve (and by analogy of human society) before and after the fall. He also deals with Milton as a revolutionary who, disillusioned with the failure of the English people a free commonwealth, was finally compelled to find the true revolution within the individual. These four chapters are based on the Centennial Lecture Series which marked the one-hundredth anniversary of Huron College, University of Western Ontario. The fifth essay in the book, "Revolt in the Desert," discusses the structure and content of Paradise Regained.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

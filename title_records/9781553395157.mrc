In Where to From Here?: Keeping Medicare Sustainable, Stephen Duckett defends Canadian Medicare, addressing key concerns and refuting criticism, while also acknowledging flaws in the system and room for improvement. Duckett argues that while the fundamentals of Medicare are sound, a great deal of change is necessary to keep it sustainable. This book envisions a Medicare that is not static and simply responsive to problems, but an active, shifting system that keeps up with the evolving needs of a rapidly changing time. Duckett systematically lays out proposals for incremental change across a range of areas including primary care, hospitals, and the health workforce. Where to From Here? Presents an unflinching defense of one of Canada's iconic policies, while keeping a clear eye on the future of the nation's health.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

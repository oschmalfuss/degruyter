It considers the development of this autonomous church, supported by the Free Church of Scotland until 1929, and the Church of Scotland thereafter in the light of its ongoing missionary purpose until its union with the Presbyterian Church of Southern Africa in 1999. Drawing from archival sources, Graham A. Duncan documents the history of South African Christianity in the context of racial segregation and apartheid. The book foregrounds the distinguished history of Scottish Presbyterianism in South Africa. It also presents a significant part of the church history of Scotland, beyond its borders, highlighting the important role played by indigenous Christians in the growth of global Christianity.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

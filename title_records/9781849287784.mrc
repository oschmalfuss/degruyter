The problems start when requirements are gathered and, if unmanaged, can flow unchecked through the entire process, potentially delivering something that’s bound to fail while, paradoxically, exactly meeting the specification. In Release and Deployment: An ITSM Narrative Account, we follow the story of the release & deployment process in fictional form.   Product overview Chris has got a new job as a release manager – but he's struggling. Parachuted into a large company to fix its release & deployment process after the catastrophic failure of its new app, Asgard, he finds himself battling an array of insular department heads who are all determined that whatever has gone wrong must be another team’s fault. They all want the finger of blame pointed elsewhere, and Chris seems to be the perfect target – so they shout down his questions and suggestions as insubordination. How can he pacify his new colleagues, avoid getting fired and get the job done?   Lessons from real projects in a narrative format This latest ITSM narrative from Daniel Mclean explains the common pitfalls of release & deployment in fictional form, with each chapter describing a difficult meeting with a different department head and featuring a set of pointers that our hero would have found beneficial. Based on the real-life experience of the author and other ITSM practitioners, Release and Deployment: An ITSM Narrative Account exposes the potential pitfalls and explores how to handle the issues that come with such projects, all in the face of shifting organisational structures and changing management objectives.   Contents Winning The Job Where Did My Job Go?

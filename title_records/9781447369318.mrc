In this book the author draws on almost 40 years’ experience as a social worker to consider CSW in core areas of practice with children and families. Fully updated to cover the impact of austerity, Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic and cost of living crisis, this accessible text book is essential reading for students, educators and practitioners of child and family social work. It features: • clearly signposted ‘theory’ and ‘practice’ sections; • over 10 case studies including those drawn from the author’s experience; • end of chapter ‘Key points’ summaries; • further reading suggestions. With expanded coverage of race and intersectionality, contextual safeguarding and critical child protection, the book champions the development of resilient social workers working towards a more just and equal world.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

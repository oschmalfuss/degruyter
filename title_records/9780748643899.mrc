He shows how these relations followed a very different pattern to the high-level discussions concerning the economic shape of the post-war world that were going on at the same time. In this way, he highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the broader process of Anglo-American economic diplomacy. Based on extensive archival research and a thorough knowledge of the secondary literature, this is a major addition to the study of Anglo-American relations in the 20th century.Explores a number of topics relevant to the broader process of post-war economic diplomacy:The Lend-Lease Export White Paper and its effects on British exports to South AmericaEconomic warfare policies such as blacklisting and the Axis replacement programmeParticular industries which had a strategic value as well as commercial importance, such as telecommunicationsEnterprises which took on an importance beyond their intrinsic worth, such as the central Brazilian railway  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

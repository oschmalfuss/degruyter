These changes are a response not only to recent developments in our conceptualisations of student learning but also to the demands a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world places on students. This book contains new perspectives on assessment and feedback provided by world renowned researchers on issues that are currently of great interest to both academic managers and teaching staff, as they try to make courses more effective and more appealing at a time when universities compete for incoming students. Rather than simply sharing recent inventions in assessment and feedback, the contributors to this book highlight the linkages between these innovations and new theorising and empirical research on assessment and student learning, thereby offering practices that are not only pioneering but evidence-based.Key FeaturesProvides a historical overview of assessment and feedback in universities showing how our understanding of assessment practices has changed over the years, both in response to new conceptualisations of learning and the changing nature of societyContains new perspectives of assessment and feedback provided by world renowned researchers on issues that are currently of great interest to both academic managers and teaching staffReports on recent innovations in assessment practices in higher educationEngages critically with recent research on assessment and feedback offering evidence-based conclusions"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

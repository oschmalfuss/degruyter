It shows how, just as in the present, migrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were forced to travel through clandestine smuggling networks, frustrating the enforcement of the ban on migration. Further, migrants who attempted to return home from sojourns in North America risked debarment at the border and deportation, while the return of migrants who had naturalized as US citizens generated friction between the United States and Ottoman governments. The author sheds light on the relationship between the imperial state and its Armenian populations in the decades leading up to the Armenian genocide. He also places the Ottoman Empire squarely in the middle of global debates on migration, border control and restriction in this period, adding to our understanding of the global historical origins of contemporary immigration politics and other issues of relevance today in the Middle East region, such borders and frontiers, migrants and refugees, and ethno-religious minorities. Key FeaturesAn in-depth study of illicit migration in a non-Western contextSheds light on the phenomenon of migrant smuggling from a historical perspectiveDemonstrates the effects of different regimes of mobility control on the migration processExamines the limits of citizenship and nationality in the context of global migrationDemonstrates the surprising convergence of anti-migrant politics and policies in both the Ottoman Empire and United States at the turn of the twentieth century  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

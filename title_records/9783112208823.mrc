Contributions to the third section, ‘Books of Hajj’, accord particular attention to events in the 19th century, when a range of new opportunities for Central Asian hajjis allowed the proliferation of new kinds of travelogues inspired by Reformist ideas. Finally, the papers in the fourth section, ‘From Hajj to Pious Visits’, remind us that, despite this Jadid influence and the development of hajj thanks to modern transportation, secondary pilgrimages – i.e. pious visits to shrines – are still extremely popular, functioning either as a substitute for hajj or as an addition ther  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

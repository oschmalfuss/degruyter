It describes the course of tobacco control policy, both regulation and taxation, in each country, and on several different levels of government. In doing so it provides a broad overview, showing how policies are similar or different, how they have changed over time, and how the two countries have learned from each other. In recent years the two countries have paid closer attention to each other's policies, both through governmental and non-governmental organizations, and each has leapfrogged the policy initiatives of the other. Now the Tobacco-Free Initiative of the World Health Organization is bringing tobacco control policy to a global level, and both countries are deeply involved. This book is a revealing exploration and comparison of the development of North American policies and the influence these policies are having in the attempt to regulate a major international business in the interests of public health.

The descriptions are illustrated in typical Corrosion Prediction Diagrams and Material Selection Diagrams. Typical material selection and prevention solutions are provided. They are also reported and described on these same diagrams. These proposals are generic, should be considered as a guideline, and have to be confirmed or infirmed during detailed engineering studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

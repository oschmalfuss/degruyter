Rich in symbolism and magical realism, this complex and wondrous family story unfolds nonsequentially in ten interrelated "tales," in a magnificent new English language translation by David Connolly. Unique in structure, style, and narrative voice, Zateli's novel, considered to be her masterpiece, combines classical mythology, ethnic folklore, and actual historical events with ingenious invention. It is a touchstone of contemporary Greek literature, awarded the Greek State Prize for Best Novel in 1994, and is an essential introduction to this rightfully celebrated author.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

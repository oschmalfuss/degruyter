So argues Benjamin Levin in Governing Education. With this book, Levin seeks to improve public understanding of the way government works, especially with regard to education policy.Based on his experience as Manitoba?s deputy minister of education from 1999 to 2002, Levin offers an insider?s account of the events and conditions that governed Manitoba?s educational policy as a way of illustrating the larger dynamics of the political process. He demonstrates how the actions of governments are rooted in diverse political demands, and looking at the current state of education and education policy in Canada, comments on its strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.Levin?s unique combination of informed analysis with real stories of real events told by participants provides an incisive exploration of government in action. While based on events in Manitoba, the same dynamics and conditions apply across the country. This book will have strong appeal to people in education, political science, and public administration.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Issues surrounding phishing, misinformation, cyber terrorism, physical security, and privacy continue to arise for both individual users and large enterprises. With technology an intrinsic part of our everyday lives, we need to be aware of digital threats, and be able to identify other threats such as phishing, ransomware, and spyware before they can wreak havoc in our professional or personal lives. This book discusses the most prevalent technological threats that we face today. It is an accessible guide that highlights the most common cyber attacks, and explores data ethics and privacy in an age where we hold so much of our PII (personally identifiable information) online. It covers cyber threats such as phishing, disinformation versus misinformation in a post-COVID-19 world, cyber terrorism, and the power of social media, and analyzes ever-evolving privacy concerns in response to technological advances. For example, does the use of drones by law enforcement offer us complete security or raise questions around the privacy of citizens? The book focuses on: The spike in phishing amid the COVID-19 pandemic Cyber terrorism The risks associated with social media Whether drones are a search-and-rescue solution or the all-seeing eye in the sky  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

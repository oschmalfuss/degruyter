While the term has achieved common usage, no one studying the region has yet addressed whether this conceptualization has real meaning-and then articulated what and where the Middle East is, or is not. This volume fills the void, offering a diverse set of voices-from political and cultural historians, to social scientists, geographers, and political economists-to debate the possible manifestations and meanings of the Middle East. At a time when geopolitical forces, social currents, and environmental concerns have brought attention to the region, this volume examines the very definition and geographic and cultural boundaries of the Middle East in an unprecedented way.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

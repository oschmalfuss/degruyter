She highlights the help they received from male physicians, which gave them access to those with decision-making power, and examines their work in both rural and urban environments with those from different economic and ethnic backgrounds. An informative look at the origins of a field that now has over thirteen thousand practitioners in Canada, Restoring the Spirit is also the compelling story of the rise of working women and their crucial contributions to the history of health care.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Canadians of Irish descent, both Catholic and Protestant, diligently followed these conflicts, and many became actively involved in the dramatic events overseas. Irish Canadian Conflict and the Struggle for Irish Independence tells the unique story of how Irish Canadians identified with their ancestral homeland during this revolutionary era. Drawing on ethnic weekly newspapers and fraternal society records, Robert McLaughlin finds new interpretations of how Orange Canadian unionists and Irish Canadian nationalists viewed their heritage, their membership in the British Empire, and even Canadian citizenship itself.McLaughlin also provides strong evidence that neither time nor distance diminished Irish Canadians' attachment to their familial homeland or their identification with their respective ethnic communities in Ireland. Irish Canadian Conflict and the Struggle for Irish Independence reconsiders existing contextual frameworks and confronts the challenging questions inherent in understanding this period.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Through a frankly revisionist interpretation, he not only demonstrates how Frost's relationship to New England and his attempt to portray himself as the "Yankee farmer poet" affected his poetry; he also shows that the regional identity became a problem both for Frost and for his readers.Originally published in 1979.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

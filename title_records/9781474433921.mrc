This was also a significant period in women’s history, in which the ‘Woman Question’ dominated public debate, and writers and commentators from a range of perspectives engaged with ideas and ideals about womanhood ranging from the ‘Angel in the House’ to the New Woman.Essays in this collection gather together expertise from leading scholars as well as emerging new voices in order to produce sustained analysis of underexplored periodicals and authors and to reveal in new ways the dynamic and integral relationship between women’s history and print culture in Victorian society. Key FeaturesPresents 35 thematically organised, research-led essays on women, periodicals and print culture in Victorian BritainFeatures cutting-edge work by senior and early career scholars working across a range of specialist fields, including literary and periodical studies, material culture studies, cultural history, art history and women’s historyExtends recent scholarship on the Victorian press by revealing the diversity and complexity of women’s interactions with periodical culture in Victorian Britain – as readers, authors, journalists, editors, engravers, illustrators, and correspondentsEnvisaged as an indispensable resource for students and specialists interested in new developments in periodical studies, the Victorian period, and women and cultural history  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

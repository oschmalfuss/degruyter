As contemporary labor and society at large search for new directions, this book should be required reading."—Victor G. Reuther"One of the many virtues of Kevin Boyle's brilliant and important history, The UAW and the Heyday of American Liberalism, is that it provides a clear picture of the road not taken."—The American Prospect"Intelligent, well written, and exhaustively researched,. Boyle's work. is part of an important and increasingly favorable reevaluation of the character of late New Deal social democracy."—Journal of American History"[Boyle's] book presents, with a remarkably assured tone and a mastery of materials, a persuasive narrative of the shortcomings of postwar liberalism from the labor perspective that was so important then and is so often ignored today."—American Political Science Review  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

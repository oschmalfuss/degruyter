Many of these new models are being developed by private sector actors, including non-profits, such as non-governmental organizations, and for-profits, such as social enterprises. These non-state actors partner extensively, often with public sector organizations. The engagement of the private sector has enormous potential to scale innovation in global health. Understanding how these leading organizations operate and target hard to reach groups may yield key insights to sustainably improve healthcare for all. Private Sector Entrepreneurship in Global Health includes works by management, medicine, and social science experts who have studied trends in private sector healthcare innovations over the last ten years. It provides a wide range of examples from many regions and health areas and outlines tools to assess the performance of innovative private sector health programs in low- and middle-income countries. The studies reported in this volume explore new marketing and finance models, digital health innovations, and unique organizational processes emerging from the private sector to serve those most in need. Drawing on the analysis of over one thousand organizations engaged in health market innovations, this volume is a valuable resource for researchers and students in management, global health, medicine, development studies, health economics, and anthropology, as well as program managers, social impact investors, funders and policymakers interested in understanding approaches emerging from the private sector in healthcare.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

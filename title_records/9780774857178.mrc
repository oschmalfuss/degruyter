All documents contributing in any way to the knowledge of psychological and medical consequences have been included in this bibliography. Materials are drawn from psychological, psychiatric, and social work literature and from personal accounts. In addition to printed books and articles, references are made to manuscripts which are housed at one of the three centres where major libraries of this kind exist. The bibliography contains titles in English, French, Polish, Dutch, and German, as well as a number of other languages. The major topics are: 1. Direct observations of, and direct reactions to, the concentration camp during imprisonment and immediately after liberation. 2. Compensation and rehabilitation. 3. Physical and psychological results. 4. Children as survivors. 5. The second generation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

It applies the recent experience of government (both British and American) to the question of the types of personnel needed and the way in which institutions of higher learning may meet those needs. The book grew out of the Princeton Bicentennial Conference on University Education and the Public Service. Its contributors include such outstanding men as Sir James Grigg, Robert A Lovett, Rowland Egger, and James Forrestal. Their concern is not merely with the routine problems of personnel training, but with the relationship between higher education and the public service in a free society.Originally published in 1975.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

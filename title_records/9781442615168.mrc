As the author tells us with warmth and enthusiasm of the early settlers, roads, bridges, inns, and mills of his native region, his story takes on a wider significance. Here, indeed, is the story of pioneer Canada, "writ small." The valley of the Lower Thames includes the greater part of what is now the county of Kent, and comprises one of the richest and most populous agricultural areas of modern Ontario. For many years it remained separated from the upper river settlements by miles of primeval forest. The Thames River was the highroad for commerce and travel that bound the people on both its banks into one community, and connected them with other communities far beyond. Professor Hamil has embellished what is commonly known of such striking pioneer figures as Thomas Talbot, the Ainse family, and others, with additional fascinating details, and brings before us many figures less well known to history but whose careers arouse admiration, sympathy, curiosity, and amusement.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

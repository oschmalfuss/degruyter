He looks at the development of the missions and functions of the Canadian forces in Germany and assesses why Canada has failed in its efforts to integrate the political, economic, and military dimensions of its foreign policy. Counterweights highlights the profound implications of Canada's failure to develop a coordinated defence policy to support its international objectives in its present-day relations with both Europe and the United States.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

It shows that colonialisation was able to co-exist with Islamisation, arguing that Islamic movements were not necessarily antithetical to modernisation, nor that Western modernity was always anathema to Islamic and local custom. Rather, in distinguishing religious from worldly affairs, they were able to adopt and adapt modern ideas and practices that were useful or relevant while maintaining the Islamic faith and ritual that they believed to be essential.In developing an understanding of the common ways in which Islam was defined and treated in Indonesia and Malaysia, we can gain a new insight to Muslim politics and culture in Southeast Asia.Key FeaturesShows how Asian Muslims and European Christians developed modern approaches to politics, law and education which formed the basis for governance and civil society in the independent nations of Indonesia and MalaysiaAdds to a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between Islam and the WestDemonstrates that colonial–Islamic relations were less confrontational, both conceptually and institutionally, than has been previously believedUses comparative history to emphasise common and parallel features between diverse forces for change  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

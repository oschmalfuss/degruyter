In this timely book, Janis Sarra draws together the work of legal scholars and practitioners from across North America to provide a comprehensive analysis of corporate governance issues in global capital markets. The contributors to this collection explore the theoretical underpinnings of corporate governance and provide concrete illustration of different models and their outcomes. While the perspectives of the authors sometimes differ, their common project is to explore different normative conceptions of the corporation in order to contribute to an analysis of global trends in corporate governance. The book measures diverse theoretical perspectives against the reality of corporate operations in current capital markets, exploring the norms that inform shifts in governance practice and the influence of regulatory regimes on governance change. Relationships both within and outside the firm are explored, including issues of accountability, ethics in decision making, and notions of efficiency in generation of corporate wealth. Legal scholars and practitioners with an interest in corporations, insolvency, and securities, as well as corporate directors will welcome this addition to their libraries.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

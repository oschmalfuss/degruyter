Many countries have introduced various measures to stop the spread of the virus and preserve human lives and livelihoods. Some commentators have considered these measures extreme, such as the restrictions imposed on people’s movement and lockdown of countries’ borders. While these measures have undoubtedly saved lives and curbed the spread of the deadly virus, they have also produced some unintended legal implications for individuals and businesses, particularly in the areas of contractual obligations, employment relationships, tourism and hospitality, company law, competition law, human rights and the rule of law, protection of vulnerable groups like migrant workers, and access to judicial and legal services. COVID-19 and Business Law: Legal Implications of a Global Pandemic identifies and discusses specific legal challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in these areas and suggests possible ways in which they could be remedied.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

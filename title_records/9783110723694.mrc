Harmonisation began to be looked at as an attempt by one legal system to impose its values on the other. A major reason for that is the lack of understanding of the scope to which these two legal traditions converge. One of the principal findings of this book is that Shari’ah and common law have many more commonalities than differences. As a result, the need for harmonisation between the two might have been exaggerated. The similarities do not need to be harmonised. Rather, they need to be acknowledged and appreciated. If the differences between Shari’ah and common law, which undoubtedly exist as evidenced in this book, are approached from the position of appreciation for commonalities, the ambiance to reconcile the differences would be more conducive to the harmonisation process which would, in that case, be reflective of compromise. This book is intended to help readers better understand Shari’ah and common law and aid harmonization efforts when needed.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

Seasonal flu pandemics, zoonotic contagions such as Ebola, swine flu and avian flu, and respiratory syndromes such as SARS and MERS have affected millions worldwide. Add the ever-present threat of terrorism and biological warfare, and the possibility of large proportions of your workforce being incapacitated is a lot stronger than you might think. How would your business fare if 50% or more of your employees, including those you rely on to execute your business continuity plan, were afflicted by illness – or worse? Although nothing can be done to prevent pandemics, their impact can be significantly mitigated. Business Continuity and the Pandemic Threat explains how. Part I: Understanding the Threat provides the reader with a detailed overview of the challenge that pandemic threats can present. It uses historical examples to illustrate how pandemics can have devastating effects not only on the global population but also on critical infrastructure, the global economy, and society. Part II: Preparing for the Inevitable considers the actions that can be taken at a global, national, corporate and individual level to mitigate the risk and limit the damage of pandemic incidents. It provides guidance on creating and validating a pandemic plan and explains how it integrates with a business continuity plan. Comprehensive case studies are provided throughout. Topics covered include: The World Health Organisation (WHO)’s pandemic phases and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC)’s Pandemic Severity Index Preventive control measures Crisis management and the composition of a crisis management team Dealing with cash-flow, staff absenteeism, home working and supply chain management Communications and media plans Pandemic issues for HR The threat to critical national infrastructure Health service contingency plans and First Responders' business continuity plans The provision of vaccines and antiviral medicines – including relevant ethical issues    aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

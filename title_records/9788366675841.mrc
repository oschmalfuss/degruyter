Education policies can be understood in the broadest sense and refer as much to supranational strategies as to national, regional and local policies, as well as to strategies and choices of various actors in the education system (academic actors, institutions, educational teams, families or even pupils). Questions of strategy and choice also refer to the development of teaching professions in specific organizational contexts where a localised appropriation of public policies is defined.This conference thus pays particular attention to issues of interdisciplinary research. Cross-disciplinary perspectives in the field of education are closely linked to methodological and epistemological issues. Such debates imply a paradigmatic emergence, where theoretical statements in the field of education can be discussed at the boundaries of the various methodologies and disciplines.Education policies and strategies, as well as the methodological and interdisciplinary challenges related to these issues, are analysed through the four following intertwined themes:- Contributions, limitations and new challenges of educational research in the field of learning and teaching fundamental skills such as reading, writing and maths, which largely determines success at school.- Multilevel strategies and policies from educational stakeholders to overcome inequalities in schools- Governance of innovation and teacher's creativity in the pedagogical transformation beyond the frontiers of the classroom.- Collaborative or participatory teacher-researcher researches and their implications on the researcher 's positioning and skills in order to contribute to educational policies.

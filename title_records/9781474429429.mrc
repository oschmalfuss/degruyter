But while the Warner brothers posed as exemplars of the New Deal in real life and in their movies, they were attempting to reverse Roosevelt’s policies within their studio and their industry.Using newly unearthed primary sources, this ground-breaking book examines the bitter and little known struggle in Hollywood and Washington D.C. during 1933 to create a National Recovery Administration (NRA) code of practice for the motion picture industry. But through the manipulation of New Deal legislation, Harry and Jack Warner, along with other studio moguls, sought to curtail workers’ rights and salaries instead of bolstering both sides of the labour/management divide as they were supposed to do under NRA regulations, attempting to serve the economic pain of the Depression as much as possible onto artists and craftsmen, not owners or management. With its tales of Hollywood stars and employees fighting to win a fair share of the proceeds of their labour, the creation of the NRA code makes for an intriguing story of financial survival, political intrigue and backstabbing during the worst of the Great Depression.Key featuresContains extensive primary research on the creation of the NRA’s motion picture code, including many new insights about the processGives students of U.S. history a new and entertaining way to examine the legacy of the Great Depression, the Hollywood studio system and President Roosevelt’s New Deal programExtensive analysis of the historical significance of the Warner Bros.' Great Depression MusicalsEntertaining stories and insights about Hollywood and U.S. government figures whose names have echoed through decades of American culture and historyDemonstrates how the Warners’ aggressive attempts to solidify their industry in 1933 ironically set the stage for the eventual downfall of the Hollywood studio system in the years after World War II  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

His analysis reveals the extent to which problems of allegiance, anxiety, and identity were inextricably involved in the colonial and national projects, an involvement which the poetry, despite its intentions, could neither mask nor resolve. Offering insight on canonical Canadian long poems from Thomas Cary's Abram's Plains to Isabella Valancy Crawford's Hugh and Ion as well as the works of many lesser-known writers, Anxious Allegiances will be of great interest to literary scholars as well as historians, political scientists, and communication theorists studying the political and economic discourses at work in imperial-colonial relations.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

An accomplished physicist, he wrote the first definitive text in English on mass spectroscopy, discovered the last stable isotope (platinum), and helped create important programs at universities and at the National Research Council. He also served on numerous councils for scientific and university organizations, and rubbed shoulders with Nobel Prize winners at international conferences.With humour and modesty, Henry Duckworth recalls trends, changes, and crises he witnessed throughout his long university career. He offers his observations, his opinions, his "version of the facts," providing a special insight into critical years in Canada's university education history, as well as his own specialty, atomic research.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Some surgical techniques, such as the Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy (UBE), have been widely applied. Meanwhile, the surgical instruments of spinal endoscopy have also significantly evolved. However, there are still problems in dealing with complex spinal disorders and diseases, including limited surgical space, high rate of equipment damage and low surgical efficiency. In this context, Professor Shisheng He and his team at the Tenth People’s Hospital of Tongji University developed the V-shape Bichannel Endoscopy System (VBE). As a brand new uniportal bichannel endoscope unlike other existing endoscopes in clinical application, the VBE allows safe and efficient transforaminal lumbar decompression and interbody fusion to be performed under real-time and full-time endoscopic monitoring. The VBE integrates the working channel and endoscopic channel so that the two become one in a “V” shape. It requires only one incision. Both positions of the instruments and the endoscope are fixed, which makes it easy to identify the surgical site during operation. It is a completely different type of endoscope to the UBE and represents a new surgical concept. The VBE is also the first endoscopic system that can be performed in both air and water medium. As a result, the surgical procedure is more convenient and easier for surgeons to master. This book is edited by Professor Shisheng HE with contributions of more than 25 experts in minimally invasive spine surgery. It provides detailed information on the design principles, indications, surgical approaches, and surgical techniques of the VBE. The authors hope that this book will be useful to those who are committed to spinal endoscopic surgery.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

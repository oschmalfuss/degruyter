First published in 1999, this revised and updated edition follows the road to devolution - with fresh detail of the obstacles which stood in the way. In a separate, companion book, Scotland's Parliament: The Story So Far Brian Taylor analyses how the Scottish Parliament has worked in practice.With his unique insight, gained in twenty-five years of covering Scottish politics as a journalist, Taylor offers an analysis of the background to the most monumental political change in Scotland since the Union.In this book, Taylor examines the popular motivation for devolution - and traces the practical steps which led to the establishment of Scotland's new Parliament. In addition, he provides a challenging assessment of Scotland's political future: tackling the issue of whether devolution will content the Scots.There is substantial analytical coverage of the Referendum, the Scotland Act and the establishment of the Parliament, following the elections in May 1999. Written in an entertaining and accessible style, this book is ideal for all those requiring an insight into the underlying issues which drive Scotland's new politics."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

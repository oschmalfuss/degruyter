This book is designed to give you an analytical set of tools to help you navigate your start-up or corporate innovation through the murky waters of real life. Every business has failures. No business succeeds without some change of plan. Navigating Your Way to Start-up Success will show you how to create a start-up designed to test its assumptions so those that are not worthy fail-often and fast. This book builds on modern start-up management techniques like Agile and Lean to bring an analytical and quantitative framework to the most common start-up failures. Navigating through those failures means finding your way to start-up success.

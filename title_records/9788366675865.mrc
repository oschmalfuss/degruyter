It proposes that natural or social survival demands drive serendipity, and serendipity is conditional on the environment and the mindset, on both individual and collective levels. From Darwin’s evolution theory to Sun Tzu’s war tactics, major innovations throughout human history are unified by this key concept. In the rapidly changing world, information is abundant but rather chaotic. The adaptive power of serendipity allows people to notice treasures within this wild sea, but only for those who understand how it works. To increase the probability of encountering and attaining serendipity, one should employ the mindsponge mechanism and the 3D process of creativity, for without these frameworks, serendipity is truly an elusive target. The book also discusses methods to build environments and cultures rich in navigational and useful information to maximize the chance of finding and capitalizing on serendipity. As a skill, serendipity has a resemblance to how kingfishers observe and hunt their prey Description of the peer review process for the book titled A New Theory of Serendipity ”A New Theory of Serendipity: Nature, Emergence and Mechanism” is covered by the following services:• Baidu Scholar• Barnes & Noble• BDS• BoD• Bowker Book Data• Ciando• CNKI Scholar (China National Knowledge Infrastructure)• Dimensions• EBSCO• ExLibris• Google Books• Google Scholar• Naviga• ReadCube• Semantic Scholar• TDOne (TDNet)• WorldCat (OCLC)• X-MOLAdditionally, the proceedings volume is registered and indexed in the Crossref database and accessible on Amazon.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

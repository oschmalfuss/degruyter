Based on the experience of a woman gynecologist who has been treating menopausal women for twenty years, the book presents thorough, unbiased answers to the questions women ask about this crucial time in their lives.Among many other topics, the authors discuss:• the physical and psychological changes a woman may undergo at menopause;• the how and why of such common menopausal symptoms as hot flashes (also called hot flushes), sleeplessness, and mood swings;• the newest research on hormone replacement therapy, with advice about choosing or rejecting this controversial treatment;• nonhormonal approaches to menopausal symptoms;• sexuality during the menopausal years;• common gynecological problems that may occur during this period and the appropriate treatments for these conditions.Women who read this book will feel as if they are conversing with an informal, sympathetic, and knowledgeable female physician who is explaining in everyday language why they feel as they do and what their options are. Written in a user-friendly question-and-answer format and incorporating helpful illustrations, a resource guide, and a glossary of common terms, Menopause and Beyond will give these women the information they need to make decisions that will affect the rest of their lives.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

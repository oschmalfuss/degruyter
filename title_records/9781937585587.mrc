Using a question/answer format, the book will introduce you to the way in which the chemical compounds known as psychedelics affect the brain, provide you with the definitions of key terms particular to the neurological and psychological vocabulary, describe the specific disorders that can realistically be helped or relieved through treatment with psychedelics, and offer information with regard to current research being conducted in the field. This text will discuss the history of the earlier research efforts and will examine the likelihood of a resurgence of interest in the successful development of methods and practices of clinical therapy assisted by psychedelic drugs. The purpose of this volume is to promote an understanding of the use of psychedelics as tools to assist therapy and to challenge the 40-year-old prejudices against research into the possible benefits of these drugs.Features:•Questions and answers about the history, research, and treatments related to psychedelic drugs •Makes a case for the re-evaluation of psychedelics — LSD, MDMA (‘ecstasy’), DMT, psilocybin, ayahuasca, peyote, ibogaine, and more — and their clinical potential for treating a range of conditions from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression to autism and cluster headaches.•Includes numerous in-text resources such as links to Web sites, videos, articles, blogs, etc. from NIH, FDA, YouTube, and university/clinical studies  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

Independence and Economic Security in Old Age focuses on the economic and social implications of aging at the level of the individual and of society as a whole. The product of a three-year research program, the book contains chapters by recognized experts in the fields of economics and econometrics, sociology, social work, medicine, epidemiology, gerontology, and nursing. The book first looks at some basic demographic issues, including the definition of "old," the changing age distribution of the population, and the demographic outlook for the next several decades. It then moves into the area of family relations, health, and economic security. The concept of "independence" among the elderly is examined and the degree of preparedness for old age by different elderly or soon-to-be elderly cohorts is considered. The measurable social contributions of the elderly are also discussed in juxtaposition with the benefits they receive. The book continues with an examination of the saving behaviour of the elderly, the appropriateness of the Consumer Price Index as a measure of inflation, the incomes of older women, and how the tax-transfer system affects the incentives of Canadians to save for retirement. Comprehensive and innovative in its consideration of the issues and implications of aging, this book will be a valuable resource for specialists and non-specialists interested in issues of population aging, for students of gerontology, economics, sociology, health studies, social work, and women's studies, and for social planners and policy makers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

It also offers a new way forward for highlighting manipulative language, accomplishing this through the innovation of a model of reading for gist. The model is an original synthesis of elements from four contemporary cognitive frameworks: connectionism, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistic evidence on inference generation, and relevance theory. Significantly, Kieran O'Halloran also shows how each of these frameworks challenges current notions of cognition in CDA and he carefully works through the implications of this for how CDA highlights manipulative language.Key FeaturesShows clearly how more systematic and reliable prediction can be made as to whether a news text is likely to manipulate someone reading for gistProvides accessible outlines of connectionism, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistic research on inference generation, relevance theory, which assume no previous knowledgeBrings together contemporary linguistic and cognitive approaches which usually do not communicateProvides a useful overview of how language cognition is understood in CDA, revealing tensions in this understanding.In offering novel criticism of some key aspects of CDA and in suggesting ways in which critical analyses of news texts can be improved, this book is likely to be both topical and controversial.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

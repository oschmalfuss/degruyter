This completely revised edition is composed of twenty-two original and comprehensive essays on key issues and themes that constitute present-day Québec politics, written by prominent and widely published specialists in areas as diverse as political science, sociology, economics, demography, and history. As a result, this book provides a full account the historical and contemporary Québec environment and offers premises for developments to come. This edition distinguishes itself by proposing five main themes for surveying the Québec condition, each with its own section. The first of these, "Québec Today: Memory, Identity, and Pluralism", contains essays on historical and contemporary identity narratives and counter-narratives in Québec, including aboriginal/state debates. "Governance" explores issues of Québec public administration, business-government relations, and federal and international relations. "Political Parties and Social Movements" discusses a series of fundamental questions on the role exercised by the various elements of civil society in Québec, ranging from the relevance of political parties to the diversity of social movements. "Education, Language, and Immigration" delves into developments in long-standing issues at the heart of the challenge of pluralism in Québec. "Territoriality, Globalization, and International Relations" tackles questions faced by every contemporary society and proposes new arenas for research for Québec.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

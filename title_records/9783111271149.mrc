Chances are your answer to that question is "not too long ago". As the author realized from first-hand experience, even well-prepared, hard-working, intelligent people can feel the strain of project management. This book presents a comprehensive set of approaches, tips and techniques that enable you to make projects more effective, successful and enjoyable. Leading Impactful Teams is a lively exploration of the "lenses" of project management – Scope, Prioritisation, Time, Cost, Quality, Risks, Team and Stakeholders – that will enable the reader to develop a "sixth sense" for potential issues that could derail their project. Replete with over 50 imaginative illustrations to explain the insights and practices that are packed into every page, the stories and ideas in this book go way past the theories and bring the reality of projects to life. It will help you understand how to make your project a success and avoid unnecessary complications. This is a powerful book for anyone involved in project management, be it at work or outside of it. James Louttit shares his refreshing, engaging and human approach, to provide you with a practical toolkit to help you and your team deliver great project outcomes with minimum stress and maximum fun.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

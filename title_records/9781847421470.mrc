With contributions from leading campaigners, academics, practitioners, direct payment users and personal assistants, the book provides an overview of the history of direct payments; presents findings from key research into direct payments and disabled people, older people, carers, people with mental health problems, people with learning difficulties and disabled children; discusses the implementation and development of direct payments provision and compares developments in the UK with those in North America. Developments in direct payments is an important source of information for social work students and practitioners and others working in the field of health and social care. The useful, up-to-date evidence and discussions relating to care, independence and control will also be of interest to users and providers of help and support.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

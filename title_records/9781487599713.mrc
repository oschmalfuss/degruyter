In this period of injustice and misery the British ruling classes, frightened by the excesses of the French Revolution, determined, at a time when economic life was changing at a rate unequalled for centuries, that existing laws and institutions should not change. And yet from this time came the moral, philanthropic, and religious ideas which transformed later England and resulted in the abolition of the slave trade, educational reforms in India, emancipation of Negroes in the British possessions, popular education and the growth of Sunday schools in England, reform of the whole penal and judicial system, industrial and parliamentary reform, and a new spirit of religious tolerance and philanthropy. The moving force in human progress at this epoch was a "brotherhood of Christian politicians" lampooned in Parliament, during their lifetime, as "the Saints" and remembered in history as "The Clapham Sect," led by Wilberforce. Dr. Howse brings together for the first time in this book material on all the activities of the Sect. He gives us sketches of members of the Set, their life as a group at home, and in the midst of their campaigns, where novel methods and ceaseless labour brought results out of all proportion to the size of the group.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

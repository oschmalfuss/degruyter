In 1802, uneducated and still unknown, he set out on the first of a series of journeys through Scotland, from the Borders to the Highlands and Hebrides. The journeys were inspiring, life-changing and often frightening. They led him to a life of chaos, failures, fame, fun and literary masterpieces.Now, a descendant follows his footsteps and reflects on his experiences, and on the remarkable rediscovery of Hogg’s works a century after his death. It is a story of tenacity, of daring to be different and, against all odds, success and a flourishing legacy. It is a lively look at an extraordinary life and some of his works, including Confessions of a Justified Sinner, considered by many to be one of the greatest novels ever written. Bruce Gilkison, a New Zealander and a great-great-grandson of Hogg’s, walked through Scotland to discover what was special about him and his journeys. Like Hogg, he had no idea where these travels might lead. He found a world of stunning landscapes, fairies and mystery, genius and ambiguity, friendships and back-stabbings, and learnt about his flawed, lovable and eccentric ancestor.Key Features:Celebrates the extraordinary life of a flawed and lovable character, and provides a brief and accessible study of Hogg’s worksExamines three Scottish journeys and provides an account of the same trips recreated by one of his great-great-grandsonsProvides a guide to parts of Hogg’s travels in the Highlands, Western Isles and some other locations, showing how these influenced his career and his writingDemonstrates Hogg’s ongoing relevance in the 21st centuryVisit Bruce Gilkison's webpage to explore more about the book"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

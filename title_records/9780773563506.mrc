The authors refer to the major bilateral talks between the United States and the former Soviet Union wherever these negotiations have a bearing on the issues in which Canada was involved. The English edition of A Diplomacy of Hope, a work originally published in French, was prepared by Derek Ellington.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

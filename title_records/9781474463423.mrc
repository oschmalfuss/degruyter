Platt provides a detailed history of the literary-critical interest in the Montaigne–Shakespeare connection from the eighteenth century to the present day. Through sustained close-readings of Montaigne’s essays and Shakespeare’s plays, Platt explores both authors’ approaches to self, knowledge and form that stress fractures, interruptions and alternatives. While the change in monarchy, the revived interest in judicial rhetoric and the alterations in Shakespeare’s acting company helped shape plays such as Measure for Measure, King Lear and The Tempest, this book contends that Shakespeare’s reading of Montaigne is an under-recognised driving force in these later plays.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

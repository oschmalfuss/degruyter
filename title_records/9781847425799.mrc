This book reports on research which examines interprofessional work with families in which mothers have a mental health problem and where there are also concerns about child protection. Breakdowns in interprofessional collaboration, issues of risk and relevant resources are all addressed. Mothers' views and experiences are contrasted with professional perspectives. Child protection and mental health services: · reports on a survey of 500 practitioners working in health, social services and the voluntary sector; · presents data from in-depth interviews with mothers with severe mental health problems; · identifies weaknesses in interprofessional coordination in this area of work; · suggests a new model for work with families where mental health problems and child protection concerns co-exist. All those involved in child protection or mental health work with families will find this book a stimulating read. This book will be of interest to practitioners, managers and policy makers as well as students studying health and social care.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

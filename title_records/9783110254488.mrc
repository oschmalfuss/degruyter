Topics covered in this volume: impact of minimal nonabelian subgroups on the structure of p-groups, classification of groups all of whose nonnormal subgroups have the same order, degrees of irreducible characters of p-groups associated with finite algebras, groups covered by few proper subgroups, p-groups of element breadth 2 and subgroup breadth 1, exact number of subgroups of given order in a metacyclic p-group, soft subgroups, p-groups with a maximal elementary abelian subgroup of order p2, p-groups generated by certain minimal nonabelian subgroups, p-groups in which certain nonabelian subgroups are 2-generator. The book contains many dozens of original exercises (with difficult exercises being solved) and a list of about 900 research problems and themes.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

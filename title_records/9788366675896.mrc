Since the introduction of the first functional computers in the 1940s, human-technology interaction has become increasingly relevant. Today's industry is characterized by fully automatized productions, supply chains, and mobility processes in the IoT "Internet of Things", for example, smart homes with their privacy, safety, and security problems. Increasingly effective and satisfying direct human-robot-interactions, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are developing. Finally, technology is networking our lives completely, private and at work. Based on this historical development of human-technology interaction, the conference proceedings comprise a collection of current interdisciplinary research and development activities across departments of engineering and natural sciences as well as human and social sciences that cover the various aspects of "Technikpsychologie". The conference takes place on 15th February 2023 with pre- and post-workshops on 14th and 16th February that are supposed to foster the interaction of students and researchers. Topics of interest include research on the psychological aspects of human-technology interaction across disciplines and application areas such as architecture, computer science, engineering, design, medicine, and aviation, as well as the legal and ethical aspects of technology. https://www.editorialmanager.com/tecpsy/default1.aspx  aThe International Symposium on Technikpsychologie celebrates 100 years of interdisciplinary research of human-technology interaction at TU Darmstadt that dates back to the foundation of the institute for "Psychotechnik" in 1922.

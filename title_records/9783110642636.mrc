The book of Sermones.1 is part of Horace's early work and constitutes his credentials for Maecenas, whose circle he joined in 38 B.C. From that time Horace lived in the highly political ambience of the Roman social elite near the centre of power. The focus of the ten poems is on the personal issue of his trustworthiness after his misjudgement in joining Brutus. The volume shows how Horace prepared himself for his future role as a political commentator on contemporary political issues. Weeda's analysis of the poems from a socio-political angle brings a new perspective on Horace's studies that differs considerably from the earlier literary analyses. Executed in a very consistent manner, this monograph shows through an in-depth interpretation of allusions the probability that Horace wrote each sermo as self-presentation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 21.

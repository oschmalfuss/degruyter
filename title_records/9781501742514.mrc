At times, Lafayette appears to be as proud, ambitious, and headstrong as his detractors have claimed. More often, he emerges as a mature and judicious leader, one who carried great weight as a principal architect of French-American cooperation. The letters also show his ability to understand American attitudes toward military and civil authority, and they indicate his realistic comprehension of strategy, tactics, and logistics.The volume is divided into five parts, each of which is introduced by a headnote summarizing Lafayette's main activities and the broader context of revolutionary events of the period. It makes clear the tensions and disharmonies between the allies that developed during the months of military inaction and fiscal difficulties, and gives us a rare look at the human side of the military effort at its highest levels.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

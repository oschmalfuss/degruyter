These traditional concerns have been transformed in recent years by investigations into the nature of language and its role in social life. Exploring the links between language and ideology has become one of the most pressing tasks of social and political analysis. In this volume John B. Thompson examines some of the outstanding contemporary contributions to the study of ideology. He focuses primarily on European social theorists and philosophers, providing concise and critical appraisals of their work. In addition to asessing the contributions of well-known thinkers, such as Jurgen Habermas and Paul Ricoeur, Thompson introduces the reader to a rich variety of authors who habe been neglected in the English-speaking world: Cornelius Castoriadis, Claude Lefort, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Pecheux, Jean Pierre Faye. This work of these authors ia analyzed with a constructive aim: through a sympathetic assessment of their views, Thompson formulates the elements of a novel account of ideology. By addressing substantive and methodological issues as well as abstract questions of justification and critique, this account seeks to integrate sociological and philosophical considerations in a unified framework for the analysis of ideology. Studies in the Theory of Ideology will be essential reading for anyone intersted in the most important developments in European philosophy and modern social thought.

Accordingly, the momentum of business opportunities and challenges has accelerated, and a firm has to continuously evaluate its market environment in order to make adjustments that reflect the firm’s individual strengths and weaknesses. This book takes as its perspective that the customer undoubtedly is positioned in the center of the firm’s overall management activities. True understanding of the customer requires efficient marketing research about the firm’s international business environment. As discussed in the first chapters of the book, the firm’s business success depends in part on its ethical standards; thus awareness of its environmental and social responsibility is required. The following chapters concentrate on various aspects of culturally biased customer behavior and how the firm ensures sensitivity when planning and selecting its marketing strategies. The most efficient techniques of international market segmentation, targeting, and strategic competitive positioning are introduced. Furthermore, concepts of consumer loyalty programs and their implementation in diversified international markets are presented. An important part is dedicated to describing suitable mixes of marketing policies for firms operating in culturally heterogeneous international markets. Finally, forecasting changes in consumer behavior as a tool of planning international marketing activities is taken into consideration. Marketing control mechanisms that seek to increase efficiency of selected marketing activities further contribute to the valuable insights of this publication. Overall, the authors' intention is to combine the newest theoretical concepts with pragmatic decisions made by firms. The book is particularly suitable for undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in international marketing, strategic and cultural management. Executives and practitioners involved in business can take fundamental and updated knowledge from this publication, which hopefully will improve their competitive positions against their rivals in the global arena.  aThis book takes as its perspective that the customer undoubtedly is positioned in the center of the firm’s overall management activities.

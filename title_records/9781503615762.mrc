It is not too much to say that modern literary criticism in Japan begins with Kobayashi. Echoes of his judgments and values are everywhere present in modern Japanese literary discourse. Indeed, his impact on later criticism is such that writing about Kobayashi has become something of a rite of passage for Japanese critics aspiring to literary leadership. This book is a collection of the most significant and enduring works from the period when Kobayashi established himself as Japan's preeminent literary critic. Reviews "Anderer has now given readers of English the opportunity to form their own conclusions [about Kobayashi]. This is no mean feat, as anyone who has dipped into the original texts knows, and for it he deserves much gratitude. . . . Given the difficulties of Kobayashi's style . . . translation is a paramount issue. Anderer has risen to the occasion admirably." —Monumenta Nipponica "By making these widely read and often "ed essays available in English, Anderer has provided a valuable service." —Japan Quarterly  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

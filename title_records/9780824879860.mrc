These are only a few of the tantalizing dishes you will find in this cookbook. The tastes of Asia and the West are brought to life through 175 recipes, along with lavish full-color photographs, in five categories of accompaniments: chutneys, relishes, pickles, sambals, and preserves. Chef Kusuma Cooray is inspired by flavors from her childhood that originate from India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Indonesia, and other South Asian countries abundant in exotic spices. At times her tempting creations show the multicultural influences of decades spent living and teaching in Hawai‘i, with its bounty of fruits and farm-fresh produce. Spices—the chef's specialty—are what make these delicacies unique, lending mystique with their fragrance and, occasionally, additional nutritional value from their medicinal and curative properties.Written throughout in a clear and engaging style, each recipe includes a brief preface by Chef Cooray, offering tips, serving suggestions, or a charming remembrance. In a similarly warm and personal tone, introductory essays open each of the five main chapters, providing explanatory background and overall preparation methods. Whether a person is a professional chef, culinary student, home cook, or simply enjoys reading cookbooks, Accompaniments is an exciting addition to their bookshelf.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 17.

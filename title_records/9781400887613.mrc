The material chosen includes official acts and statements from every level of the Chinese government, editorials and major articles from the People's Daily, dispatches of the New China News Agency and other government media, the writings of Chinese scholars, and the speeches of China's leaders. In an extensive introduction, Professors Cohen and Chiu discuss the experience of previous Chinese governments with international law, and the relationship of China's domestic public order and its foreign policy to its views of international law.Originally published in 1974.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

The evidence was given in a makeshift courtroom set up in David?s own home. Anthropologist Antonia Mills was present during these proceedings, and in this book, she introduces and contextualizes the evidence within the Delgamuukw case.In his testimony, David provides a rich description of the Witsuwit?en way of life as well as the injustices suffered at the hands of Indian agents and settlers. He ends his testimony saying, ?If you hang on to these words, everything will be all right.? The challenge of hearing his voice, and using it to negotiate the meaning and substance of Aboriginal rights remains unresolved and resonant.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

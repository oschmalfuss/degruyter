Yet inoculation with BCG is not the only method by means of which an immunity can be induced even in tuberculosis. It is also true that opinions by no means agree as to the value of BCG vaccination; particularly in the field of veterinary medicine an almost entirely unfavourable evaluation of the procedure has recently prevailed. As a result BCG vaccination is no longer accepted to such an emphatic degree today. Investigations with the objective of improving or replacing the method are claiming greater attention, especially in Germany. In the monograph the authors present a review of current problems in the field of vaccination in tuberculosis, and correlate the extensive experimental and clinical material including the work published in recent years. At a time when new developments seem to be making headway, this account will provide a useful summary of information and a basis for further work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Although Marx's philosophy is usually regarded as one of the most influential ever written, its seeming ambiguities and contradictions have long puzzled readers. By uncovering the framework that unifies the writings of Karl Marx, John McMurtry has made an advance of signal importance for all areas of Marxian studies.The many valuable features of Professor McMurtry's analysis include clear, coordinated definitions of all concepts central to Marx's thought. Closely reasoned explanations illuminate such controversial theories and positions as economic determinism, ideology, and the laws of society and history. Here, too, are definitive formulations of Marx's generally neglected or denied theories of human nature, technological determinism, and mind, plus precise delineations of his stands on traditional political and philosophical questions.The author contrasts Marx's ideas with those of other important thinkers and provides a systematic survey of standard objections that refutes many of Marx's best-known critics and disciples. In addition, Professor McMurtry offers a precise critique of the historical genesis and economic and political structures of "Marxist" societies. Throughout, direct reference to the texts and concrete illustrations explain all relevant concepts, positions, and issues.Originally published in 1978.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

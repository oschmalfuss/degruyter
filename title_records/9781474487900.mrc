In these 20 essays written over a 20-year period, Buchanan shines a light on the experimental nature of the work of Deleuze and Guattari. He shows it to be constitutively incomplete as their project was an attempt to understand our contemporary situation which is constantly changing and can therefore never be understood in a complete way.Clustered around five main themes – Method, Film, Space, Analysis and Assemblages – Buchanan's book will appeal to experts as well as those new to Deleuze and Guattari working across literary criticism, film studies, cultural studies, political theory and philosophy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

In The Pink Wave, Regina M. Matheson and William W. Parsons explore this inspiring phenomenon and its impact on women’s representation.Drawing on national surveys and in-depth interviews of over 900 women, across almost every state, Matheson and Parsons show us why more women decided to run for state legislature during the Trump administration, the obstacles they faced on the campaign trail, and whether they ultimately succeeded or failed in their bid for office. Candidates share valuable lessons they learned from their recent campaign experiences, providing future insight for women—on both sides of the aisle—who may be inspired to follow in their footsteps.Matheson and Parsons examine the impact Donald Trump had on women candidates—both positive and negative—and women’s ambitions to pursue political office. The Pink Wave celebrates the hundreds of trailblazing women creating new political opportunities for representation, now and in the future.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

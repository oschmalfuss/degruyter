He creates paradigmatic occasions of thinking with Deleuze – thinking with him and through him, following diverse lines of his thought and engaging concepts to extend his thought into areas Deleuze did not explore.These frequently cited, classic essays have all been reworked to make them even better. Each one offers a separate entry into Deleuze’s thought but they all serve to illuminate the pivotal role the arts play in the political project of inventing a people to come and the broader project of promoting an ecologically viable new earth.Key FeaturesBrings together 18 classics essays with two brand-new piecesIncludes a preface outlining Bogue’s intellectual journey with DeleuzeOffers a unique engagement with Deleuze’s thought and Asian art formsIllustrates the viability of science fiction for engaging Deleuzian politics and aestheticsSituates the arts in relation to ecology and Deleuze and Guattari’s ontology"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

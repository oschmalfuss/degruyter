Taking its cue from James’s observations while challenging his assessment, this study examines the full stylistic range of the novels and biographies which Trollope explored in his final decade, from allegory, satire, and parody, through poignancy, the classics, and paraphrasis, to character, bathos, and fantasy.Blending literary criticism with intellectual history and Frankfurt School theory, Frederik Van Dam shows how Trollope’s creation of this new, impersonal aesthetic was driven by a desire to intervene in contemporary debates on topics such as suburban sociability and marginalist economics, colonialism and national sovereignty, educational and jurisprudential reforms.Key featuresPresents a stylistic analysis of a major Victorian novelistReads Victorian literature through the lens of German RomanticismPresents a panorama of Victorian intellectual debates on colonialism, economics, nationalism, the classics, pedagogy, legal reform, and urban sociabilityExamines the writings from the last decade of Trollope’s life that have received only scant critical attention, such as his novellas and his biographies  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

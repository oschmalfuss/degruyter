The essays collected here explore the extensive administrative archives of the archbishops during this period. This is one of the largest but least exploited collections of medieval church records to survive in Europe, and is now dispersed across a number of institutions including The National Archives (London) and the Borthwick Institute for Archives (York). They examine the form and functions of the archbishops' registers and other archives, and use them to shed light on the ecclesiastical, political, cultural and social history of this turbulent period. The core focus is on the north of England and its relationship with royal government. Particular subjects addressed include the sources of tension and opportunity rooted in the prosecution of war with Scotland, the creation of networks of clerical administrators in royal government, and the impact of those networks on local society and royal affairs. Other topics include the wide-ranging spiritual and temporal responsibilities of the archbishops, their housing and landscapes, and the role of women within the church.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

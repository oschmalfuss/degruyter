Cars are vehicles for television, a fixture of the shows and ads that drive TV. In this original approach to contemporary television, Paul Grainge looks beyond questions of speed, spoilers and cylinders to explore the small screen intimacy of cars - the way people interact, sing and dwell in the habitat of automobiles. Considering the industrial, cultural and aesthetic relation between TV and cars, Grainge examines how comedy entertainment such as sitcoms, talk shows, web series and vlogs have been drawn to the practice of ‘passengering’.Getting under the bonnet of popular ‘drive-and-talk’ series like The Trip, Carpool Karaoke, Peter Kay’s Car Share and Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, this engaging interdisciplinary excursion finds new ways to look at both television and the social life of cars.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

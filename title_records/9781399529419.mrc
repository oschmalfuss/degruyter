It offers the first full and consistent edition of this text, based on the Bannatyne and other MSS (including an allegedly lost printed text of Alexander Montgomerie’s Cherrie and the Slae). This volume contains the entire text of the 1724 two volume collection (including the prefatory material, also reproduced-but without MS variants- in Prose), an introduction explaining Ramsay’s relationship with the material, how he came to be acquainted with it, and an explanation of his strategy to both present and co-create a Scottish literary tradition from before the Union of the Crowns in 1603. It also includes comprehensive notes on the text as Ramsay presents it.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

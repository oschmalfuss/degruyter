This essential framework has transformed the lives of billions, but in the last generation it has come under considerable attack. Privatisation, market choice and outsourcing have depleted the material infrastructure at the core of everyday life, and the foundational economy is in desperate need of renewal.This book sets out the principles and initiatives to end the degradation of the foundational economy and restore its essential place in society. In the face of our growing needs, the authors argue, politics must refocus on foundational consumption and universal minimum access and quality.This book is relevant to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8, Decent work and economic growth  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

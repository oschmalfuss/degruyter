Drawing on the hospital's rich archives, it investigates how training was institutionalised and organised at Barts to explore the shifting nature of medical education between the eighteenth and late-twentieth century. Medical Education at St Bartholomew's Hospital, in analysing the history of the medical college at Barts, explores the relationship between clinical study, science and the institution to look at the rise of the hospital student, the growth of laboratory medicine, and the evolution of a research culture. It places the changing nature of training at Barts in the context of metropolitan and national developments to analyse the structure of medical training, the University of London and its impact on medical education, and the experiences of the students and staff. Questions are asked about how academic medicine developed and about the relationship between training, the bedside, teaching hospitals and the politics of healthcare and higher education. In looking at these areas, existing notions of the "development" of medical education are problematised to provide a study that explores the nature of medical education at Barts and in London.

With their propensity for fine architecture, music, and ritual, adherents to the sect attracted the attention of the religious, political, and social élites. Their leader and founder, David Willson, was one of the most prolific religious writers and theorists in Canada at the time. The Children of Peace sought to create a church where God spoke directly to all and where both Christians and Jews could find a home. McIntyre looks at life in the community and places the sect within its broader historical contexts. His examination of the community's buildings and artefacts provides insight into the beliefs and behaviour of its adherents. Children of Peace makes an important contribution to the growing field of religious and cultural history in Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

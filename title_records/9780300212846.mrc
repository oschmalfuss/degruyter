His writings offer a new view of his activities in architecture and urban planning, and provide the intellectual context for his own work as an architect, much of which is still controversial and often poorly understood. This book includes 16 essays dating from 1951 to 1977, ten of which are previously unpublished. The Writings of Josep Lluís Sert illuminates Sert's contributions to 20th-century architecture, urban design, and design pedagogy, and makes clear the similarities and differences between his ideas and those of his mentor, Le Corbusier. The essays reveal Sert's advocacy both for pedestrian urbanism and for planning in relation to the natural environment, ideas that have become important issues in contemporary urban design. Each text is introduced by the editor, Eric Mumford, a scholar of CIAM, Sert, and modern urbanism.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Drawing on his own experiences as well as a wealth of interviews and surveys, Ronald Bishop tells why these loosely structured games mattered—camaraderie, opportunities to develop social skills, and independence from the world of adults. Bishop contrasts his and others' childhoods with the experiences of today's overscheduled and overcommitted youth who find much of their time taken up by organized sports and other highly supervised activities. When Play Was Play celebrates memories of a past era, when kids were free to explore their neighborhoods, had time to throw together an afternoon game of stickball, and spent much of their lives playing outside just for the sake of playing.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

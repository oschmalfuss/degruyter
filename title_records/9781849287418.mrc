Corporate information security is often hindered by a lack of adequate communication between the security team and the rest of the organisation . Information security affects the whole company and is a responsibility shared by all staff, so failing to obtain wider acceptance can endanger the security of the entire organisation . Many consider information security a block, not a benefit, however, and view security professionals with suspicion if not outright hostility. As a security professional, how can you get broader buy-in from your colleagues? Information Security: A Practical Guide addresses that issue by providing an overview of basic information security practices that will enable your security team to better engage with their peers to address the threats facing the organisation as a whole. Product overview Covering everything from your first day at work as an information security professional to developing and implementing enterprise-wide information security processes, Information Security: A Practical Guide explains the basics of information security, and how to explain them to management and others so that security risks can be appropriately addressed. Topics covered include: How to understand the security culture of the organisation Getting to know the organisation and building relationships with key personnel How to identify gaps in the organisation’s security set-up The impact of compromise on the organisation Identifying, categorising and prioritising risks The five levels of risk appetite and how to apply risk treatments via security controls Understanding the threats facing your organisation and how to communicate them How to raise security awareness and engage with specific peer groups System mapping and documentation (including control boundaries and where risks exist) The importance of conducting regular penetration testing and what to do with the results Information security policies and processes A standards-based approach to information security If you’re starting a new job as an information security professional, Information Security: A Practical Guide contains all you need to know. About the author Tom Mooney has over 10 years’ IT experience working with sensitive information. Currently HM Land Registry’s information security risk advisor, where he works with project teams and the wider business to deliver key business systems securely, his key responsibility is to act as an intermediary between management and IT teams to ensure appropriate security controls are put in place. His extensive experience has led him to develop many skills and techniques to converse with people who are not technical or information security experts. Many of these are found in this book. He has a BSc (Hons) in information and computer security, and is also a CESG certified professional.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

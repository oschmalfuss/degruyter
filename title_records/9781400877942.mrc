An exploring mind, deeply religious spirit, and scientist's respect for truth, combined with singular personal charm, made of him not only a missionary in science, but a natural leader among the botanists of the United States. He set for his goal the building of a complete structure of the house of botany, and he took the lead in organizing defined branches of study which eliminated the waste of duplicated effort. The thread of this story of his life is maintained largely through excerpts of the correspondence of Coulter and his associates and by means of articles from the Botanical Gazette, which he founded.Originally published in 1944.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

The first part investigates the reasons for foreign investors seeking out Singapore as a base for their operations and points to the significance of viewing this aspect of the problem in a broader regional, even global, social and political context. Part two consists largely of fieldwork material which support and augment the conclusions of the preceding part. Part Three is a case study of the important petroleum-refining industry, and highlights its role in Singapore's overall economic growth. The fourth, a field study of the perceptions held by one group of small local businessmen (the motor fuel retailers, toward the oil companies) suggests the importance of cultural factors in the understanding of the evolving situation which follows upon the large-scale influx of foreign investment. Concludes with a basically reflective paper on the wider social and political ramifications of foreign investment in Singapore.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

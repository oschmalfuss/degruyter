Though various new approaches gained favor, they had one thing in common: they advocated moving away from the traditional reliance on an individual architect's knowledge and instincts and toward the use of external tools and processes that were considered objective, logical, or natural. Automatic architecture was born.   The quixotic attempts to formulate such design processes extended modernist principles  and tried to draw architecture closer to mathematics and the sciences. By focusing on design methods, and by examining evidence at a range of scales-from institutions to individual buildings-Automatic Architecture offers an alternative to narratives of this period that have presented postmodernism as a question of style, as the methods and techniques traced here have been more deeply consequential than the many stylistic shifts of the past half century. Sean Keller closes the book with an analysis of the contemporary condition, suggesting future paths for architectural practice that work through, but also beyond, the merely automatic.    aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 22.

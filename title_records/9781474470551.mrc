This makes it difficult for them to advise on church law or appear in ecclesiastical courts, tribunals or commissions. Following well-received seminars on the Church of Scotland's legal system in 2007, and with additional contributions from the Scottish Episcopal Church and the Roman Catholic Church, this book was specially written to fill this gap. It includes chapters on the various Churches' polity, processes and judicial procedures, including the Church of Scotland’s Judicial Commission and disciplinary processes.Key FeaturesA welcome reference for those who work and hold positions of responsibility within Churches, for those preparing for ministry or legal practice, and for practitioners called upon to appear before Church courtsContributions written by senior office-bearers of the General Assembly explain the law and practice of the Church of ScotlandIncludes a full description of the systems of the Scottish Episcopal ChurchWith a valuable note from the Roman Catholic Church  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

A well-known and widely read author in the first half of this century, Sullivan wrote thrillers, historical romance, children's stories, and novels set in the north (The Great Divide, The Fur Masters, Cariboo Road). Now there is no complete collection of his published works anywhere in the world. In this literary biography of Alan Sullivan, the author interweaves Sullivan's life story and his literary career. Drawing on published and unpublished material as well as on information supplied by Sullivan's four children, McLeod traces the influence on Sullivan's writings of his early years in Sault Ste. Marie and in mining and construction camps, of society life in Toronto, of visits to the Arctic and Europe, and residence on an English country estate. Sullivan is seen as a man whose essential characteristics are those of Canada, and whose literary work is parallelled by the paintings of the Group of Seven artists. His literary works are discussed and evaluated in the light of Sullivan's own and other Canadian critical theories. The bibliography provides a convenient listing of Sullivan's book-length publications. The volume will be of value to students of literature, but will also appeal to anyone interested in Canadian life and culture.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

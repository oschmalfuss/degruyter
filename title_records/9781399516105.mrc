Morrison offers a reassessment of Mary Russell Mitford’s and Elizabeth Gaskell’s provincial fiction, sometimes deprecated within a genre frequently considered ‘minor literature’, and demonstrates the importance of their work to the development of George Eliot’s liberalism in the age of high realism. Although Gaskell was influenced by Mitford, and Eliot by Gaskell, only a handful of scholars have considered the affinities and resemblances among them. None have done so in depth. Establishing a chain of influence, this book examines the three authors’ interrelated careers: the challenges they encountered in achieving distinction within the literary sphere; the various pressures exerted on them by publishers, reviewers, and editors; and the career-enhancing possibilities afforded, and the limitations imposed, by different modes of publication. Attending to publication history, genre, and narrative voice, Morrison suggests new ways to think about provincialism, liberalism, and women’s networked authorship in the nineteenth century.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

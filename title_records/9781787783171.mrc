Resilience is the ability to cope with setbacks and find solutions to problems. It is the ability to bounce back from adversity and hardships, learn from experiences and move on. Being resilient means having the strength and conviction to confront life’s challenges and adapt positively to difficult circumstances. A 2020 Gartner survey revealed that 74% of CFOs and finance leaders planned to keep their previously on-site workforce working remotely post COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, the work environment had become one of constant change. People could no longer expect job stability, working time had become increasingly fluid and sophistication of technology meant that businesses were no longer limited to specific geographical locations to manage their workforce. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the uncertainty and stress it created to the realisation that the world of work will need to change to deal with economic uncertainties and modified ways of working, means that resilience is now more important than ever. Why is resilience important? We need to build our resilience to cope effectively with ambiguity and change, and to bounce back in the face of adversity. This is particularly important if we manage and lead others at work. Well-being in the Workplace – A guide to resilience for individuals and teams is aimed at managers who need to build resilience in both themselves and their team and improve their own and others’ well-being. Remote working makes it even harder for managers to identify if team members are struggling, and employees may lack the support network to help them cope with stress in their work and home environments. Recognise the warning signs and take positive action A practical guide, this book will equip managers with the skills and confidence to effectively build their own and others’ resilience and support their team’s well-being. It covers: An introduction to what resilience is and why we need it; The challenges for managers of building resilience in themselves and others; How to assess your own levels of resilience; Tips for physical, emotional, mental and social well-being; How to build resilience in team members; and The benefits of building resilience and how to make habits stick. Managers, team leaders, those in HR roles, and employees looking to adapt to new ways of working will find this book invaluable.

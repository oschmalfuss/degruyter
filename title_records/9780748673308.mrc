The controversies surrounding these relations are as alive and pressing now as at any point over the course of the past four centuries.Adrian Johnston’s transcendental materialism offers a new theoretical approach to these issues. Arming himself with resources provided by German idealism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, the life sciences and contemporary philosophical developments, Johnston formulates an account of subjectivity that, although being both materialist and naturalist, does full justice to human beings as irreducible to natural matter alone. At the same time he argues against relapses into idealisms, dualisms and spiritualisms.Adventures in Transcendental Materialism elaborates Johnston’s position through critical engagements with some of today’s most important thinkers including Slavoj Žižek, Alain Badiou, Catherine Malabou, Jean-Claude Milner, Martin Hägglund, William Connolly, and Jane Bennett.Key FeaturesCritically engages with some of today’s most important thinkers, including Slavoj Žižek, Alain Badiou, Catherine Malabou, Jean-Claude Milner, Martin Hägglund, William Connolly and Jane BennettJohnston is a collaborator and interlocutor with Badiou, Žižek, and Malabou, and this book contains material from ongoing debates between him and these three authorsCombines Continental-style philosophy with the empirical sciencesSplit into 3 parts: I.

The Annual Review of Global Peace Operations is the first comprehensive source of information on this crucial topic, designed for students, scholars, and practitioners alike. Unique in its breadth and depth of coverage, the Review presents the most detailed collection of data on peace operations—those launched by the UN, by regional organizations, by coalitions, and by individual nations—that is available. Features of the inaugural volume include an introductory essay on peace operations doctrine; incisive analyses of all peacekeeping missions on the ground in 2005; in-depth explorations of key missions and trends, focusing on those operations that have faced significant challenges or undergone major developments during the year; and extensive illustrative graphs, charts, tables, and photographs. The editorially independent Review has been launched by the Center on International Cooperation at New York University, with the support of the Peacekeeping Best Practices Section of the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and in cooperation with the International Peace Institute.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

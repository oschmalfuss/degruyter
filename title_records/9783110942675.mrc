This volume yields name-forms and elements not found in Manx literature or dictionaries. As all but a handful of names predate the Scandinavian period (9th-13th centuries) and as documentary material from that time till the 16th century is largely absent, the testimony of place-names is important for the distribution of name elements reflecting the geography and showing patterns of settlement, whether Celtic, Scandinavian, etc, and for comparative place-name research in adjacent areas, particularly Ireland, south-western Scotland, and northern England.  aVolume 5 comprises the three central and eastern parishes of Kirk Braddan, Kirk Marown, and Kirk Santan.

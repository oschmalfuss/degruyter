Such a range suggests a multiplicity of approaches to a body of work itself multiple, produced by an artist who underwent any number of transformations and reinventions over his long writing career. Many of the essays collected here explore Beckett’s debt to his age, Beckett very much a product of a culture in transition, which change he would help foster. But much of Beckett’s creative struggle was to find a new way, his own way. Most of the essays that comprise this volume detail that struggle, toward a way we now call Beckettian.Key FeaturesIncludes 24 original essays divided into thematic sections: modernism, theory, editing, introducing, and performing and covers Beckett’s drama, staging, fiction, poetry and proseUnique collection of Beckett scholarship by a leading Beckett critic and theatre director brought together for the first timeNew introductory essay reflecting on the development of Beckett scholarship  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

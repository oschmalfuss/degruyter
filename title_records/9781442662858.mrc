It brings together scholars from several disciplines to address the policy and management challenges in various sectors of northern Ontario's economy, including the mining, pulp and paper, and tourism industries, and both small- and medium-sized businesses.Governance in Northern Ontario assesses the role of the provincial government and its economic policy intervention in the region's economic development. The contributors evaluate the relationship between the provincial and local governments and the business sector, and also looser structures of policy networks, such as those of First Nations and other interested community groups. Focusing on the nature of partnerships between governments and societal interests, Governance in Northern Ontario makes a significant contribution to the theories and practice of public policy governance in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

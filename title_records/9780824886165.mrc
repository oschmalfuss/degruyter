His reception was such that he angrily called the place the "Island of Thieves." Ever since then, the identity of that island has been the subject of much speculation, with most geographers, hydrographers, explorers, and historians declaring in favor of one or another of the islands in the Carolinian archipelago of Micronesia. However, there is little agreement as to which one of these many islands it might be.Another faction theorizes that it was instead one of the Marianas, a chain of islands to the north of the Carolines, but still within the Micronesian culture area. A third group leans toward Mindanao in the Philippine archipelago.Dr. Lessa seeks to "set the record straight." With the perspicacity of the true scholarly investigator, he sifts through multitudes of applicable information from the fields of ethnohistory, ethnology, and anthropology, and relentlessly pursues the resulting clues to a fascinating resolution. Written in highly readable style, the text is augmented by illustrations, maps, and tables. A model example of cross-disciplinary scholarly research, this book will also be a bonanza to the amateur student of the great age of exploration.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

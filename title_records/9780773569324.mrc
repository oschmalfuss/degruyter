Based on a systematic analysis of available information and data, this volume provides an overview of Greece's socio-economic profile, which changed significantly during the studied period. The collapse of the dictatorship in 1974 and Greece's entry into the European Union (EU) in 1980 have led to a consolidation of democratic institutions and the improvement of living standards. During the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced high rates of economic development and relatively low unemployment rates. However, this increase in economic development has slowed since the early 1980s and the unemployment rate has risen, particularly among young people. Consistent with recent social trends in other Western societies, Greek society has become more tolerant and permissive, with more diverse and flexible moral norms. However, the prevailing family model remains traditional and the Greek Orthodox Church continues to have a strong influence on many aspects of Greek society, including social, political, and cultural life. The organization of work also follows traditional patterns, despite the introduction of new and flexible forms of employment. Female participation in the labour market remains relatively low, despite legislation and regulations that promote equality of opportunities between the sexes. Consistent with recent social trends in other Western societies, Greece's population is aging and the birth rate has stabilized at a relatively low level.

With few exceptions, only those established by the Communist Party and other state agencies were permitted.The picture has changed considerably since doi moi. From proactive self-help associations for the disabled to mass, semi-state or “non-governmental” organizations, the Vietnamese people are getting together to voice their collective and specific interests vis à vis the state. The process of getting together, voicing ideas, acting in concert, and attempting to influence policy in some cases is ongoing and in constant flux. This book presents original case studies of the gamut of organizations in Vietnam today and analyses their relationships with umbrella state organizations which are themselves evolving. Getting Organized in Vietnam also constitutes an enquiry into the term “civil society” itself. The contributors examine current thinking about the nature of the state in Vietnam in particular. Included here are the first attempts to provide a framework for assessing and categorizing the bewildering array of small organizations in Vietnam: which ones are weakly connected to the state, which ones are independent of the state but perhaps dependent on outside funding agencies. This book is a must for scholars, policymakers, journalists and others interested in understanding political and social change in Vietnam and other transitional economies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

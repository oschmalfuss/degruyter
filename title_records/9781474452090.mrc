From romantic novelist Elinor Glyn in the 1920s to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle today, this collection examines some of the history, contemporary manifestations and enduring appeal of US-UK romance across popular culture. Looking at both historical and contemporary case-studies, drawn from across film, television, music, literature, news and politics, this is a timely intervention into the popular romantic discourse of US-UK relations, at a critical and transitional moment in the ongoing viability of the special relationship.ContributorsJay Bamber, independent scholar Caroline Bainbridge, University of Roehampton Barbara Jane Brickman, University of AlabamaWilliam Brown, University of RoehamptonShelley Cobb, University of Southampton Neil Ewen, University of WinchesterAlice Guilluy, London Film AcademyHannah Hamad, Cardiff UniversityDeborah Jermyn, University of RoehamptonVeera Mäkelä, University of HelsinkiInmaculada Pérez-Casal, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela Karen Randell, Nottingham Trent UniversityManuela Ruiz, University of ZaragozaMartha Shearer, King's College LondonFrances Smith, University of Sussex Theodore Louis Trost, University of AlabamaAlexis Weedon, University of BedfordshireNathalie Weidhase, Birmingham City University  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

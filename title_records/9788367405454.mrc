The chapters written by authors from the USA, Canada, Belgium, France, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary highlight differences in the migration trajectories of people from various countries of the region, while also shedding light on the shared experience of immigrants of different time periods. The chapters provide valuable insights for migration studies, as well as the history of the Americas and Europe, and study the topic of immigration to Canada from a broad array of vantage points, among others, exploring the complex migration pathway from the places of emigration to Canada, the impact of race, ethnicity, and religion on migration, inter-American aspects of immigration to Canada, the contributions of immigrants to the evolving image(s) of Canada in Central and Eastern Europe, and the representations of immigration in literature, arts, and music.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

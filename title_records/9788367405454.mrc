The chapters written by authors from the USA, Canada, Belgium, France, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary highlight differences in the migration trajectories of people from various countries of the region, while also shedding light on the shared experience of immigrants of different time periods. The chapters provide valuable insights for migration studies, as well as the history of the Americas and Europe, and study the topic of immigration to Canada from a broad array of vantage points, among others, exploring the complex migration pathway from the places of emigration to Canada, the impact of race, ethnicity, and religion on migration, inter-American aspects of immigration to Canada, the contributions of immigrants to the evolving image(s) of Canada in Central and Eastern Europe, and the representations of immigration in literature, arts, and music. HJEAS Books is a new series of peer-reviewed, open-access scholarly books launched by the Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies. The volumes of the series reflect scholarship in the areas covered by the Journal, which include but are not limited to the literature, film, art, history, and religion of the United States, Canada, Ireland, England, Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand.

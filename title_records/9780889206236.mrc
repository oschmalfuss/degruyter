It met at Victoria University in Toronto on October 26 to 28, 1972, and was entitled: "The Theology of Karl Barth." The addresses by Markus Barth and Arthur Cochrane were given during the Colloquium Dinner; the others were more 'formal' and followed by at times very animated discussion. During that colloquium the Karl Barth Society of North America was inaugurated. Its aim, far from being a personality-cult of Karl Barth, is to encourage a critical and constructive theology through the exploration of his work. It is envisaged that the assistance given to the Karl Barth Stiftung in Europe in its purpose to collect and preserve all literature by and about Karl Barth, the publication of a complete edition of his works together with the establishment on this Continent of a similar collection will make available for theological research materials that will adequately meet the proposed aim. Both the academic and the pastoral areas of theology are meant to benefit from the endeavours of this Society. —from the Introduction by Martin Rumscheidt  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

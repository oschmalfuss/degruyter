In this book, the authors analyse the causes of some of the major disasters from the last thirty years and explain what could have been done better, before and after the event. Unlike many titles on business continuity and disaster recovery, In Hindsight: A compendium of Business Continuity case studies does not build up from the theory of business continuity planning. Instead, it takes apart real events and reveals the themes that contributed to each disaster. Plan for the worst Using these incidents as case studies, the authors demonstrate the potentially devastating results for organisations that have not planned for the worst. Crucially, the book proposes measures that could have helped to minimise the risks and consequences. Learn from other people’s mistakes By showing the potential repercussions of a badly thought-out disaster management and business continuity plan, this book helps you avoid making similar mistakes, reduce risks and enable faster recovery when things do go wrong.

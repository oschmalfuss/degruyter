A year later this effort was in shambles despite massive assistance from abroad. Anti-Bolshevik forces were in retreat and soon were completely annihilated. During 1919 the British government concluded that the costs of bringing down Bolshevism in Russia were prohibitively high. This book is an account of how this conclusion was reached, and of the conflict over Russian policy between David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill. Richard H. Ullman is Associate Professor of Politics and International Affairs, Princeton University.

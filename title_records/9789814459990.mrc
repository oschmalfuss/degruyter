The author's familiarity with both popular and academic writings in Mandarin has yielded rare, first-hand, and often bottom-up views on the Dongjiaozong movement from actors directly involved in the movement. As a result, readers get a better understanding of the personalities, leadership dynamics, creative strategies of control and resistance within this social movement as well as its ability to exploit political vulnerabilities and interpersonal relationships to cajole, negotiate and arm-twist the state in its bid to defend Chinese education in Malaysia. This book will be of interest to practitioners in the fields of political science and Malaysian studies, in general, and the study of state-society relations and social movements in non-liberal democratic contexts, in particular." - Associate Professor Goh Beng Lan, Department of Southeast Asian Studies, National University of Singapore "Ang Ming Chee's insightful examination of the decades-long Chinese education movement in Malaysia is a powerful example of scholarship exemplifying deep passion and rigorous analysis. This important study will be a major reference for those interested in Chinese politics in Malaysia and the social resistance movements under non-democratic conditions for years to come."- Associate Professor Jamie S.

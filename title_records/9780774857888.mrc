Created through close co-operation between government, the private sector, and the unviersity, it is the successor to the British Columbia Atlas of Resources which, for twenty years, has been the standard reference work used by schools, industry, government, and the general public. The most recent data available have been used to give an accurate, comprehensive picture of British Columbia's economy as it is today. Comparative studies show the development orf the province's manpower and natural resources as well as the rapid growth of industry and technology since the beginning of the century. In party, the emphasis of the atlas reflects thousands of specific requests for up-to-date resource information rercorded over the last ten years. For easy reference, the three main subject areas are divded into sixty-one topics -- each illustrated by a map page and a facing page of interpretive text. They include: The People: changes in population and settlement partterns; distribution of Native peoples; growth of the labour force. The Environment: geological, topographical, and climatic features; concentration of fish and game. Resource Use: distribution of natural resources; development of indstury; communication and transportation links; location of energy resources; development of recreational lands. The atlas has 115 maps, 74 illustrations, tables and diagrams. Bold colours and explicit keys contribue to the easy, rapid interpretation of data. A Gazetteer and an Historical and Statistical Summary are included to provide a quick reference for the most commonly sought facts and to supplement maps and text.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

The right to learn explores a wide range of strategies, both at the policy level and in the field, to improve educational success among such disadvantaged children, taking stock of good practice in a selection of EU member states, chosen to reflect the diversity in systems and policies that currently exist. The book suggests that a number of strategies are effective and feasible. The authors recommend that a sufficiently powerful opinion movement is needed to promote the transfer of experience and action on different levels. They conclude with several suggestions for good practice - not just equal opportunity and equal treatment but also equal outcomes strategies. The right to learn is important reading for teachers, school administrators, educational researchers, policy makers, NGOs, parents' associations, those engaged in youth services and teacher training, and in formulating policies to secure the social integration of the young generation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

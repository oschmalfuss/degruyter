Many of the problems that arise at the end of a lease have their roots in what was agreed at the beginning. This clear and practical book gives a thorough exposition of the law governing dilapidations in Scotland. It covers the following areas:The underlying common lawInterpretation of the leaseRemedies for breach of repairing obligationCommon parts and service chargeDispute resolutionDilapidations claims at lease expiry have become increasingly important in recent years. Changing occupier requirements and reduced occupier demand has led to closer scrutiny of the liabilities of outgoing tenants and of the intention of landlords with regard to redevelopment and/or re-letting of a property. Additionally, developments in contract law and the rules of interpretation of contracts in the last decade have affected how a court will interpret or construe a lease in the event of dispute on its terms, which has given rise to important cases.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The Young Scots' Society and the Ligue nationaliste canadienne carried these liberal nationalist ideas. This book offers a comparative and historical examination of their ideas and politics, exploring the Young Scots as a movement, as well as the ideas of key Nationalistes. James Kennedy argues that the growth of the Young Scots' Society and the Ligue nationaliste canadienne was largely in response to changes within empire, state, and civil society. He suggests that the actions of the British Empire and the Canadian state not only prompted nationalist responses in Scotland and Quebec respectively, but also shaped their liberal character. His comparative analysis provides insights that would not arise from a single case study of either movement, while detailing the important roles that geopolitics, consociation and federation, and organized religion played in the creation of nationalist philosophies. The first-ever comparative history of nationalism in Scotland and Quebec, Liberal Nationalisms is an insightful study of nascent political nationalisms and a major contribution to the scholarship of nationalist movements in the early twentieth century.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

IT4B is not about reinventing your favourite method, but putting it into the context of improvement and identifying any potential gaps. Written by service management experts with years of real-life experience, ensuring sensible, practical and effective advice. This book reads like a conversation on IT service management. Rather than reinventing traditional IT frameworks or methods, IT4B provides a coherent understanding of digital readiness for your enterprise. It offers insight and coaching, rather than ready-made advice. This book aims to: Use well-known service management concepts, methods and processes to focus on digital innovation; Promote a reuse-reduce-recycle approach to improve projects, rather than grow-expand-explode; and Use the IT4B framework as a lens that will guide all your projects.   So what is IT4B? IT ‘4’ for business is an acronym for the business community to use, and is intended to help the business side of a company determine whether their IT is ‘aligned’ or ‘integrated’ and what is missing. This book serves as a guide for the identification and the implementation of IT methods. Brian Johnson has held key leadership and strategic roles in government and private companies. He was part of the UK government team that created the ITIL approach. He has written a number of books on ITIL, the software lifecycle and the role of IT in business. When he isn’t working or writing, Brian’s passion is playing football. Walter Zondervan is a digital innovator who is always looking to help organisations reach their full potential. In his 20+ years of experience, he became fascinated with translating business goals into IT strategy. As a digital transformation strategist, he developed a comprehensive approach to this, which has been partially adopted by the BiSL® Next framework for business information management. Working with Brian Johnson on BiSL® Next, they decided to take it a step further and combine their insights to create a practical IT4B approach to digital transformation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

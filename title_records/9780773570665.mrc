He also challenges the social and educational views of the founders, giving voice to those who did not share the founders' vision and criticized the course the college was determined to pursue. These dissenting voices help us understand the problems the new college faced and the steps a new generation of leadership would take to point the college in a new direction, and define a very different relationship with the modern world.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

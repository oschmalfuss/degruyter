Am I smart enough? How do I know which major is a good choice? How can I make friends, get good grades, and still get enough sleep? Whether you’re making the transition to university straight out of high school or have taken a gap year (or a few!), this guided tour through first year demystifies the process, from registering for class and making the most of orientation to knowing when to pull an all-nighter and making time to prep for exams. University is supposed to be challenging, but, as Janet Miller promises, it doesn’t need to be stressful or overwhelming. As a university counsellor and registered psychologist with a behind-closed-doors view of university life, she understands that when students have guidance and support – when they know what to expect – they thrive. With wit and wisdom, she shares what she’s learned from thousands of students who have walked the campus hallways before you. This book doesn’t tell you what you should do. It tells you what you need to know so you can follow in their footsteps and hit your own stride.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

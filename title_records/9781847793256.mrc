It closely examines the history of childhood in post-independence Ireland, and it breaks new ground in examining the role of the state in caring for its most vulnerable citizens.Maguire gives voice to those children who formed a significant proportion of the Irish population, but who have been ignored in the historical record. More importantly, it uses their experiences as lenses through which to re-evaluate Catholic influence in post-independence Irish society. An essential and timely work, this book offers a different interpretation of the relationships between the Catholic Church, the political establishment, and Irish people; it is important for academics and non-academics interested in the history of family and childhood as well as twentieth-century Irish social history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

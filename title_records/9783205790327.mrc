To recapitulate the nine years of work of the Stability Pact in the field of democracy, economy and security, we decided to invite a wide range of authors and specialists to put together a comprehensive publication, that will provide an in depth analysis of the achievements of the Stability Pact and include political documents that shaped the developments of South Eastern Europe.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 08.

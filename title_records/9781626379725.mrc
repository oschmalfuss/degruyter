That is the question at the heart of Alejandro Toledo’s new book. Toledo begins from the premise that the uneven caliber of schools and universities in the region is only part of the problem. Drawing on his own childhood experiences living in deep poverty, he addresses the inequalities in health care, the large pockets of economic deprivation, and the discrimination against Indigenous peoples that continue to characterize Latin American societies—and to negatively affect student learning. He also takes a hard look at teacher competence, the harsh conditions of rural education, and the pitfalls of privatizing higher education. His examples of successes, and his call for sustained political leadership in reforming education, are both realistic and refreshingly candid.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

Using the knowledge gained from many years of experience in various government departments and her familiarity with several successful building conversation projects, Ann Falkner has written this practical handbook for those concerned about preserving heritage structures. She covers clearly and in detail the various problems to be faced and actions to be taken, and analyses the assistance available through legislation at all three levels of government. Without Our Past? deals with inventories and how they are conducted, and, through a series of concrete examples, with the evaluation and selection of worthwhile buildings. It explains acquisition procedures for all types of properties, municipal powers under provincial planning acts, and control through specific zoning. It offers suggestions on how to re-use an outdated structure and how to create a compatible environment around a building, and it points out the value of publicity and local interest in gaining general support and cooperation. In a separate chapter expenses and finances are covered, including fund raising and the increasing monetary benefits of conservation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

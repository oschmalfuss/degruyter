It heralds a new, more dynamic way of reading Shakespeare as a supremely intelligent and creative political thinker, whose history plays address and illuminate the very questions with which cultural historicists have been so preoccupied since the 1980s. The book reignites old debates and re-energises recent bids to humanise Shakespeare and to restore agency to the individual in the critical readings of his plays.Key Features* Re-evaluates the legacy of new historicism and cultural materialism and intervenes in vital theoretical debates about human nature, the relationship between the individual and society, and the scope for individual political agency* Questions the anti-essentialist, anti-humanist theoretical framework that has held sway in Shakespeare studies since the 1980s and develops a critical practice which appreciates Shakespeare's startling insights into personal agency in history and ideology* Provides original new readings of the first and second tetralogies that demonstrate Shakespeare's unique and radical take on the workings of power, history, and individual agencyKeywordsShakespeare, History Plays, Anti-humanism, New Historicism, Cultural Materialism, Critical Theory"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Born in Leatherhead in Surrey in 1747, he joined the Navy at the age of 13 as a Captain's servant during the Seven Years War, then as a midshipman, and a lieutenant. He was promoted to Captain in 1870 during the American War of Independence and in the French Revolutionary War. The significant advance in his service came during his posting to Jamaica in 1796 when as senior captain he was promoted to temporary rank of Commodore and acting Commander-in-Chief. Acquitting himself well he was transferred to the Mediterranean where he commanded the naval conquest of Minorca. He then took over command at Gibraltar and by capturing a Spanish convoy he secured personal prosperity. Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Leeward Islands he captured the Danish and Swedish Islands and added to his wealth with prizes captured on his watch. Securing the Admiralty's confidence, he was given the Jamaica command. This book concentrates on his service from 1793 until 1802 and is divided into seven parts.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

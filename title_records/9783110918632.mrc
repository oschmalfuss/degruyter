Dissension, defined as a propositional attitude of the speaker's disagreement is deemed to be highly threatening to the social image of an individual and is to be uttered using specific Face-work strategies and/or a higher degree of redress for the social image. After a discussion of the concepts 'Dissension' and 'Face-work', the corpus and methodology, the results of an analysis of about eight hours of recorded conversation and about 370 occurrences of Dissension are presented. According to their scope, they were classified into four categories, which proved relevant for the set of 38 Face-work strategies found to express them, as well as the elements employed in their linguistic expression. No specific linguistic means for expressing Dissension was found, although most cases display semantically negative lexical components. Linguistic elements from many word classes as well as devices such as Deixis manipulation were used for Face-work. The results are also interpreted in regard to the relationship between Dissension, its different categories and the several strategies used to express them. An appendix presents all occurrences of Dissension found in the corpus as well as a detailed examination of their categories and linguistic forms, Face-work strategies and linguistic means used to convey them.  aDissension, defined as a propositional attitude of the speaker's disagreement is classified into four categories according to its scope. Its occurrences in German discussions were analyzed according to their linguistic expressions and 'Face-work'. No specific linguistic means for expressing Dissension was found, although most cases display semantically negative lexical components. 38 Face-work strategies were defined based on Brown/Levinson (1978, 1987). Linguistic elements from many word classes as well as devices such as Deixis manipulation were used for Face-work purposes.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 17.

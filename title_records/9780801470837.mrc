The team-based care movement is at the heart of major changes in medical education and will become an element in the new accreditation standards.Through its Centre for Interprofessional Education, the pioneering approach in this area taken by the University of Toronto has attracted international attention. The role of the Centre for IPE, a formal partnership between the University of Toronto and the Toronto Academic Health Sciences Network, is to create a hub for the university and the many teaching hospitals where all core parties can be actively engaged in redesigning this new model of health care. In Creating the Health Care Team of the Future, Sioban Nelson, Maria Tassone, and Brian D. Hodges give a brief background of the Toronto Model and provide a step-by-step guide to developing an IPE program.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

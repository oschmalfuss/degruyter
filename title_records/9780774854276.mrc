Reforms introduced by the Chinese government since 1978 were the cause of this transformation. The Pearl River Delta has had the highest recorded rate of economic growth in East Asia and has done so through a pattern of development which differed significantly from that found in other regions of fast growth. George Lin reviews the processes by which this remarkable transformation was achieved and discusses the implications of such change. Red Capitalism in South China looks at theories of regional development and the patterns of spatial and economic restructuring in the Delta, and provides three case studies which focus on the transformation of the peasant economy, transport development, and the influence of Hong Kong. This book represents the best account yet available of the implications of change in South China. It examines a phenomenon of particular importance not only because the speed, and magnitude of changes taking place in the region are truly fascinating but also because its patterns of growth and development are distinct from those of the Western capitalist world or the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

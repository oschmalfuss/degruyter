With this book, we root our work in the geospatial reality of Palestinian film culture and move towards a deeper understanding of transnationalism, refugeeship, and the power of a global identityDraws attention to Palestinian women directors and their contribution, which often gets lost in the geopoliticsPalestinian film culture is unique due to its geopolitical circumstances, including continued colonialism and occupation, and the refugeeship of its citizens. The scholarship on the politics of film and its role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – including activist work, international solidarity films, and work on Palestinian documentaries – is usually defined by historical overviews of geopolitical events and developments. In contrast, this book offers an auteur-focused study of a global artist influenced by but not limited to the political discourse surrounding the Occupied Palestinian Territories.Jacir is a Palestinian woman whose work is recognised globally as innovative, politically challenging, and genre-crossing. The book offers an in-depth study of her films and other works by locating it in a geospatial, sociocultural, and critical theoretical framework. It critically analyses Annemarie Jacir’s development as an artist, filmmaker, and curator of film.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

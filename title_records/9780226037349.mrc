Barnes has written an autobiography that is both the success story of a professional woman as well as a profoundly moving reflection on growing older. Transcending the personal details of her life, Barnes' memoir stands as an important contribution to the intellectual history of our century. "An intimate record of our times and of the ongoing issues that challenge us to define ourselves over and over again."-Kirkus Reviews "An engaging autobiography that spans not only [Barnes'] self-identified period of 'flourishing' but virtually all the twentieth century."-Library Journal "Thoughtful, gracefully written reflections. . . . Readers will be glad they pursued an unusual woman's intellectual and personal journey."-Booklist "An accessible, wonderfully written book packed with wisdom and insight."-Denver Post "Absorbing and satisfying."-Gertrude Reif Hughes, Women's Review of Books  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

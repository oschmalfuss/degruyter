Areas that receive particular attention are William's historical writings, his historical vision and interpretation of England's past; William and kingship; William's language; William's medical knowledge; the influence of Bede and other ancient writers on William's historiography; William and chronology; William, Anselm of Canterbury and reform of the English Church; William and the LatinClassics; William and the Jews; and William as hagiographer. Overall, the volume offers a broad coverage of William's learning, wide-ranging interests and significance as revealed in his writings. Rodney M.

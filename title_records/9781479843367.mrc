In the United States alone, it is estimated that over 20% of the population will be considered "mixed race" by 2050. Public figures-such as former President Barack Obama and Hollywood actress Ruth Negga-further highlight the highly diverse backgrounds of those classified under the umbrella term of "multiracial." Multiracial Parents considers how mixed-race parents identify with and draw from their cultural backgrounds in raising and socializing their children. Miri Song presents a groundbreaking examination of how the meanings and practices surrounding multiracial identification are passed down through the generations.A revealing portrait of how multiracial identity is and is not transmitted to children, Multiracial Parents focuses on couples comprised of one White and one non-white minority, who were mostly "first generation mixed," situating her findings in a trans-Atlantic framework. By drawing on detailed narratives about the parents' children and family lives, this book explores what it means to be multiracial, and whether multiracial identity and status will matter for multiracial people's children. Many couples suggested that their very existence (and their children's) is a step toward breaking down boundaries about the meaning of race and that the idea of a mixed-race population is increasingly becoming normalized, despite existing concerns about racism and racial bias within and beyond various communities. A critical perspective on contemporary multiracial families, Multiracial Parents raises fundamental questions about the future significance of racial boundaries and identities.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 25.

Laing collection) Draws upon funded-AHRC and Wellcome projects Six case study chapters offering fresh perspectives on the production, mediation and reception of some well-known and cult British and Hollywood films Accessibly written to appeal to non-academic audiences interested in cinema, popular science and the Sixties as well as students and other scholarsIn the 1960s, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals intervened in and influenced cinema culture in unprecedented ways, changing how films were conceived, produced, censored, exhibited and received by audiences.Drawing upon extensive archival research, Demons of the Mind provides the first interdisciplinary account of the complex contestations and cross-pollinations of the ‘psy’ sciences (psychiatry, psychoanalysis, psychology) and cinema in Britain and America during the defining ‘long 1960s’ period of the late-1950s to early-1970s.This interdisciplinary book incorporates expertise from film studies, history of science and medicine, and science communication. The originality of this book is not solely its interdisciplinarity and exploration beyond the narrow study of representational practices – typically the primary focus of other books on cinema and the psy professions. In large part, this book’s originality rests on its investigation of situated practices and interplay between ideas, expertise and professionals that constitute the fields of mental health and media.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

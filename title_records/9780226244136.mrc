Yet, few teachers understand what imagination is or how it lends itself to practical methods and techniques that can be used easily in classroom instruction. In this book, Kieran Egan-winner of the prestigious Grawemeyer Award for his work on imagination-takes up where his Teaching as Story Telling left off, offering practical help for teachers who want to engage, stimulate, and develop the imaginative and learning processes of children between the ages of eight to fifteen. This book is not about unusually imaginative students and teachers. Rather, it is about the typical student's imaginative life and how it can be stimulated in learning, how the average teacher can plan to achieve this aim, and how the curriculum can be structured to help achieve this aim. Slim and determinedly practical, this book contains a wealth of concrete examples of curriculum design and teaching techniques structured to appeal specifically to children in their middle school years.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 22.

In The Noise of Culture, he speculates on the role of literature in the post-literary culture of the information age and proposes a vital reorientation of the study of literature, both affirming its specificity and exploring its developing relationship with modem science.Paulson discusses literature in the context of information theory, particularly the theory of self-organizing and autonomous systems. Reviewing and building upon the work of such thinkers as Michel Serres, Henri Atlan, Francisco Varela, and Judith Schlanger, Paulson offers a new kind of conceptual vocabulary for literary theory. He concludes that literature functions as the noise of culture, a source of variety in the circulation and production of ideas and a rich and indeterminate margin through which messages are sent and transformed.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

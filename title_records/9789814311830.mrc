He is one of the most respected and influential economists of the twentieth century. He is also the first Indonesian demographer. This background has contributed to his wide focus on development issues such as poverty, food security, education, health, and family planning. This book provides invaluable insight for all who are interested in Indonesia's economic development. It is divided into six parts: Indonesia's Development Plan; Implementation of Indonesian Development; Facing Economic Crises; Foreign Debt Management; Equity and Development; and Indonesia and the World.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Dr. Frank MacKinnon examines the roles of politicians, officials, trustees, and others who today wield the power in education, and discusses the effect of their administration on the schools, the teachers, and the curriculum.Dr. MacKinnon advocates strongly taking the politics out of education, and delegating more responsibility and freedom to the schools and to the teachers. Only by this means, he feels, can education become sufficiently effective in a democratic society and in a challenging and uncertain world. The kind of changes to the administration of schools and in the status and functions of teachers required to bring about improvement have long since been made, Dr MacKinnon holds, in other governmental activities and in other professions. The changes he recommends will, he suggests, provide better educational facilities for the country as a whole and better schooling for a larger number of children.Dr. MacKinnon has taught in both high school and university, and, as principal, he has administered every level from grade one to the second year of university including normal school. He has thus dealt with pupils of all ages and experienced a wide range of educational administration. He has served on many educational boards and committees. From this extensive background he draws many telling examples and anecdotes that will strike home. His comments and suggestions, made to provoke discussion and encourage improvement, will be of interest to members of provincial and municipal governments, school boards, administrators and teachers, and all citizens concerned about the education of young people. Although Dr. MacKinnon hits hard he does so not just to break down existing institutions, but because he has strong faith in the capacities of children and teachers. He covets for the latter a place of dignity and respect, and for the former an opportunity to develop individual character and initiative. He is, in fact, a believer in education  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

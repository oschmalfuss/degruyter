She traces the progression from the bonded warehouse of the nineteenth century to today’s foreign-trade zones, enclaves where goods are processed while simultaneously inside the United States and outside US customs territory. Foreign-trade zones channel jobs to American workers by converting American cities into international ports, and to understand them, Orenstein tells us, we should look at them in the simplest of terms: as warehouses. Going further, Orenstein contends that these zones—nearly 800 of which are scattered across the United States—are emblematic of how warehouses have begun to supplant factories on the terrain of logistics. In the age of Amazon and Walmart, circulation is so crucial to how and where goods are produced that it is increasingly inseparable from production, such that warehouses rank as some of the most pivotal spaces of global capitalism. Drawing from cultural geography, cultural history, and political economy, and vividly documented with photos, ads, maps, and other ephemera, Out of Stock nimbly demonstrates the centrality of warehouses for corporations, workers, cities, and empires.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

His curious combinations of satire and sentiment, geniality and deviousness, snobbery and anti-snobbery, and his habits of retreating from one disguise to another, have made him difficult to deal with, and his practice of exposing his stories as fictions has evoked hostility in many critics who are none the less fascinated by him. In this original and revealing study of the major novels, Juliet McMaster contends that Thackery is a consummate artist and a highly sophisticated ironist, exploiting to the full the potential of the various personae he adopts, and introducing ambiguity deliberately, to sharpen the reader’s moral perceptions and to evoke the complexity of experience itself.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

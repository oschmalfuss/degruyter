His films, a number of which were made in collaboration with the poet-turned-scriptwriter Jacques Prévert, include such well-known works as Le Quai des brumes, Le Jour se lève and Les Enfants du paradis. As the first book to be written on Carné for a number of years, it offers a fresh perspective on his cinema, particularly through a re-examination of his post-war work – although many of these films were very popular and offer a fascinating insight into France at the time, they have, until now, largely been neglected.Adopting a carefully crafted aesthetic, his films explore a tension between pessimism and entrapment on the one hand, and transcendence, idealised romantic love and a populist celebration of working-class life on the other. His career traversed key moments in French cinema, including poetic realism, the tradition of quality and the French New Wave, and spanned important historical moments such as the Popular Front of the 1930s, the Second World War and France’s post-war modernisation. This book will be of interest to scholars, students and film-lovers alike.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

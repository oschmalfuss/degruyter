The contemporary oil and gas industry is now intensely focussed on cost-saving and the UK has radical redrawn its revenue-raising expectations.This updated third edition of UK Oil and Gas Law has been published in two volumes: this volume focuses on resource management and regulatory law, while the other deals with commercial and contract law issues. The twin volumes bring together academic and practising lawyers, mainly based in Aberdeen, Europe’s Energy Capital, to consider the key regulatory and commercial dimensions of an ever-changing hydrocarbon province.New for this editionA detailed analysis of the Wood Review and its implementation, including its effects on the licensing system and third party access to infrastructureA discussion of the the changing face of the UK’s tax systemA new chapter on onshore shale developmentsAn expanded treatment of decommissioning issues, including a new chapter on Decommissioning SecurityContributorsJudith Aldersey-Williams, Partner, CMS, Nabarro and Olswang, Aberdeen.

Focusing on the utopian genre (which includes positive and negative worlds), this book offers an in-depth account of the ways in which the most creative writers, filmmakers and thinkers have envisioned alternative worlds in which surveillance in various forms plays a key concern. Ranging from Thomas More’s genre-defining Utopia to Spike Jones’ provocative film Her, Imagining Surveillance explores the long history of surveillance in creative texts well before and after George Orwell’s iconic Nineteen Eighty-Four. It fits that key novel into a five hundred year narrative that includes some of the most provocative and inventive accounts of surveillance as it is and as it might be in the future. The book explains the sustained use of these works by surveillance scholars, but goes much further and deeper in explicating their brilliant and challenging diversity. With chapters on surveillance studies, surveillance in utopias before Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four itself, and utopian texts post-Orwell that deal with visibility, spaces, identity, technology and the shape of things to come, Imagining Surveillance sits firmly in the emerging cultural studies of surveillance.Key Features:The first sustained account of the representation of surveillance in eutopian and dystopian literature and filmCharts surveillance’s historical development and creative responses to that developmentProvides a detailed critical account of the ways that surveillance studies has utilised utopias to formulate its ideasOffers new readings of literary texts and films from More’s Utopia through George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four to Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake and films from Fritz Lang’s Metropolis to Neil Blomkamp’s Elysium and beyond  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

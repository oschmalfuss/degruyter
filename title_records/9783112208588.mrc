Through this book one relives the experience of Fawzi Habashi – tear by tear, and whip by whip. One feels and relives the pain, anguish, smiles, laughter, and the sorrow…' Ahmad Ismail in El-Ahaly (opposition) Newspaper, Egypt • 'The book […] is an account of the trials and tribulations of Engineer Fawzi Habashi who spent a good part of his life within a number of different prisons across Egypt.' Magda El-Guindy in Al-Ahram (state owned) Newspaper, Egypt • 'They summoned Fawzi and ordered him to confess as to the names of the greater party leadership within the prison camp. He was barbarically tortured, and towards the end of this intensive torture session he took off his watch along with his wedding ring and handed it to the prison administration officers so that they could send it to his wife in prison. This was Fawzi’s way of indicating that he was willing to die before confessing. This was a clear and simple sign to the officers who were torturing him that they would not be able to extract any information from him.'

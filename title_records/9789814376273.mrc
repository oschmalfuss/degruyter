The aim of this study is to document the strategies adopted by a selection of these groups, and the programmes that they are implementing in Thailand, in order to understand how cultural specificity (of mobility and education) guides their participation, and how gender relations are formed and transformed. While attempting to synthesize the disparate data collected on Thai women and their organizations, the authors have tried to evolve an analytical framework to study the meaning and significance of women's lives and efforts.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 22.

It abandons the traditional university relationship to the student of in loco parentis, and considers faculty and students alike as "willing individuals, capable of judgement," responsible for their conduct and its consequences. The report considers how these principles may be applied in such areas as activity by staff and students; membership in organized groups; residences; university campus publications; use of university property; university security services; administrative response to disorder and danger of violence; and due process within the university. In today’s atmosphere of protest and response, this report should be standard reference on all campuses.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

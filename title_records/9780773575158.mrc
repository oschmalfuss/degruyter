Over time, recognizing that she has outgrown the kindly but uneducated couple who raise her, she begins a relationship with an artist who initiates her into the wider world and adulthood. Psyche is the gripping story of a mother's undying faith in her child's survival and the child's remarkable resilience as she embarks on a dramatic journey of self-discovery through art, education, and interaction with a varied cast of colourful characters. This 1959 international bestseller focuses on issues of character and environment in an unconventional coming-of-age story that draws the reader into an exploration of still decidedly modern themes: the search for biological roots and identity, and the question of what most influences that identity - nature or nurture?  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

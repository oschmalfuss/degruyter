Major crises such as the highjacking of the Chesapeake by Confederate partisans and the destructive cruise of the CSS Tallahassee - the only Confederate warship to reach a mainland British North American port - in addition to Halifax's growing importance as a communications link for the South and the Maritimes' involvement in blockade running are recounted in detail. In Armageddon's Shadow also explores the impact of the Civil War at a more personal level. Marquis highlights Maritimers' growing support for the beleaguered Confederacy, despite the colonies' official neutrality, and the grave implications this had for local race relations. He describes the impact of refugees, crimping, and recruiting on Maritimers' attitudes and recounts the experiences of some of the thousands of men born in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island who served in the Civil War. Drawing extensively on newspaper reports, personal papers, and local histories, Marquis captures the drama of events as they unfolded, effectively putting the reader into the thick of the action and into the minds of the individuals involved. In Armageddon's Shadow is a must read for anyone with an interest in the American Civil War or the history of the Maritime provinces.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

On the other, the violence persists and so does the counter-attack against those who seek to expose it. Patrizia Romito's extraordinary book describes the links between discrimination, violence against women and violence against children and, uniquely, uncovers the strategies and tactics used for concealing it. Her analysis, corroborated by a solid theoretical framework as well as up-to-date international research data, powerfully reveals the interconnectedness of what might appear as separate events or measures. The book also demonstrates how the same tactics and strategies are at work in various different countries. Written in a clear and direct style, the book is an essential tool for anyone - professional, researcher or activist - wanting to understand male violence against women and children and to oppose it.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

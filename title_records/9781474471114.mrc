The opening and closing sections follow a chronological structure, while the main body of the volume takes a thematic approach, covering the following key areas:Slavery in the Old SouthSlave LifeThe Economics of SlaverySlavery and the LawSlave ResistancePro-Slavery IdeologyThe Anti-Slavery MovementSlavery and ExpansionPrimary documents are drawn from a wide variety of sources: extracts from diaries, letters, laws, debates, oral testimonies, travellers' accounts, inventories, journals, autobiographies, petitions and novels. Black and white, male and female testimony is drawn upon. The secondary readings have been selected for including important, provocative discussions, based on the editor's experience of what works well in a teaching environment. Where possible the secondary readings link with the primary documents.As well as an introduction to the volume, each section consists of an introduction, a secondary reading and a selection of shorter primary documents.

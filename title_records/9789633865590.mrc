Children of Atlantis offers a snapshot of virtually a whole generation of young people on the threshold of their working lives, uprooted from the world in which they grew up, confronting the task of making something of their lives in the face of the catastrophe that has overwhelmed them, their families, their friends and their homeland. Their voices are varied, expressing pain, anger, uncertainty, hope and the positive energy of youth. What they have in common is a sense of disbelief and bewilderment at the forces unleashed in what was their country.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

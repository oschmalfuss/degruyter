In Knowing It When You See It, Patrick O'Donnell compares several late novels and stories by Henry James with a series of films directed by Michael Haneké, Alfred Hitchcock, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, and Lars Von Trier. O'Donnell argues that these issues find parallels in films made at the other end of an arc extending from the last decades of the nineteenth century to the initial years of the twenty-first. In mapping affinities between literature and film, he is not concerned with adaptation or discursivity, but rather with how the "visual" is represented in two mediums—with how seeing becomes knowledge, how framing what is seen becomes a critical part of the story that is conveyed, and how the perspective of the camera or the narrator shapes reality. Both James and these later auteurs "think" visually in ways that inter-illuminate their fictions and films, and newly bring into relief the trajectory of modernity in relation to visuality.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

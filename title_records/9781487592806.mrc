Sections are devoted to the start of school broadcasting in each province, the establishment of national school broadcasts, and the work of the National Advisory Council on School Broadcasting. In the story, the part played by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in initiating and promoting the work of teaching by radio and in providing the facilities upon which it is based, is a significant one. The book is the first authoritative description, by the man largely responsible for its success, of an important and fruitful experiment in federal-provincial co-operation in the thorny field of education. To this co-operation is due the high standard of the school broadcasts which have earned for Canada world-wide recognition and appreciation. The book also describes the international aspects of this cooperation, particularly between Canada and Australia, Great Britain, and the United States.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

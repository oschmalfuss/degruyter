This, coupled with an improvement in literacy, may well trigger significant advances in the next generation. Conversely, if normal development is retarded, a potentially disastrous situation could result. In all developing countries of the world, education in rural areas has always presented an array of difficult problems. Although the strategy for rural education has to be different for different climes and cultures, most of the basic problems have common features. The agricultural population is conservative and their economic position necessitates optimal utilization of all human and material resources. However, all developing nations are now realizing more intensely than ever before that sheer exploitation of physical resources would not accelerate economic growth unless due preference is given to the development of human resources. Here, written from the viewpoint of a Pakistani scholar, is a much-needed progress report which encompasses the impact of educational, social, political, and health education programs in the rural population as well as an analysis of these programs in their wider historical perspective.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

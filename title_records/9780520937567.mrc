With around 8,000 species living in California, beetles represent the largest and most diverse group of organisms in the state and are an excellent subject for study since they can be found almost everywhere—in backyards, gardens, forests, and deserts. This, the only guide to California beetles available, is the perfect book for anyone—from outdoor enthusiasts to professional biologists—who wants to explore the fascinating world of beetles. In addition to providing information on where to find and how to study beetles, the book also gives an engaging and accessible overview of their natural history, biology, distribution, and relation to humans. * 51 color illustrations and supporting black-and-white photographs and drawings identify the characteristics and habits of 23 of the most conspicuous and interesting beetle families in California * Chapters describe beetles of special interest—fossil species, endangered species, pests, biological control agents, and more * Includes an annotated list of terrestrial and aquatic beetle habitats by season, information on starting and caring for a beetle collection, details on keeping beetles alive in the classroom, and a checklist of California beetle families  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

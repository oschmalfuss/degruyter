The different approaches to security, however, mean that there is often a knowledge gap between those trying to implement ISO27001 and the IT specialists trying to put the necessary best practice controls in place using Microsoft®’s technical controls. ISO27001 in a Windows® Environment, Third Edition bridges the gap and gives essential guidance to everyone involved in a Windows®-based ISO27001 project. Completely up to date advice Explaining best practice implementation over a wide range of Windows® environments, this third edition covers Windows® 7 and 8, and Microsoft® Windows Server® 2008 and 2012. It is also completely aligned to ISO27001:2013, the latest version of the international standard for information security management. Improved understanding for faster, better implementation Using the guidance in this book, ISO27001 project managers can explain the best practice requirements of the standard to technical security specialists in a way that they will quickly understand. In the same way, technical experts can use this book to gain a deeper understanding of ISO27001, making it easier for them to implement technical solutions that fulfil the requirements. This means that everyone on the project talks the same language, helping the team to work together more effectively. Essential reading for security professionals: Details the various controls required under ISO27001, together with the relevant Microsoft® products that can be used to implement them. Explains how to make the most of Windows® security features. Ideal for bridging the ISO27001/Windows ® security knowledge gap. Successfully implement ISO27001 in a Windows® environment with this step-by-step guide  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

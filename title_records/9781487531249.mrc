Cybersecurity Management draws on case studies to analyze cybercrime at the macro-level, and evaluates the strategic and organizational issues connected to cybersecurity. Cross-disciplinary in its focus, orientation, and scope, the textbook looks at emerging communication technologies that are currently under development to tackle emerging threats to public privacy. The text is suitable for cybersecurity courses in Business and Public Policy Programs. Cybersecurity Management provides insights into the nature and extent of cyber-threats to organizations and consumers, and how such threats evolve with new technological advances, and factors ranging from cultural, organizational, and macro‐environmental. Cybersecurity Management articulates the effects of new and evolving information and communication technologies and systems on cybersecurity and privacy issues. As the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed, we are all dependent on the internet as not only a source for information, but also person to person connection, thus our changes of encountering cyber threats is higher than ever. Cybersecurity Management aims to increase the awareness of and preparedness to handle such threats among policy makers, planners, and the public.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

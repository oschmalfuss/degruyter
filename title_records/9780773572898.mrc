The shift to full time, although advocated by progressive educators, also led to a backlash in Toronto resulting in a provincial inquiry in Ontario that threatened to return the University of Toronto to government control. Her book not only provides a history of Canadian medical education and large-scale philanthropy in North America but also analyses the effects of philanthropic giving, the practice of matching fund gifts, and accountability.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

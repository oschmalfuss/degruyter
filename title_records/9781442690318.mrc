In Pirandello's Theatre of Living Masks, Umberto Mariani and Alice Gladstone Mariani offer the first new edition in nearly sixty years of six of his major works - Liola, It Is So If You Think So, Six Characters in Search of an Author, Henry IV, Each in His Own Way, and The Mountain Giants.Mariani and Mariani's translations of these texts are both vibrant and faithful to the originals, using contemporary expressions and unambiguous language to facilitate readability and comprehension. This edition also offers a critical introduction to each play's most significant characters and structures, highlighting themes and poetics as they correspond to Pirandello's entire body of work. Pirandello's Theatre of Living Masks will appeal to those already familiar with his plays and those looking to discover one of the twentieth century's great dramatists.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

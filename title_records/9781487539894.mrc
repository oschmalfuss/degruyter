Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and archival research, Michelle Wyndham-West explores the creation and circulation of gendered risk as it was deployed in pharmaceutical and policy discourses surrounding the roll-out of the HPV vaccine. The book contextualizes the background for how gendered risk was mediated by two groups of women: mothers negotiating the vaccine for their daughters in school-based immunization programs and university students who experienced frequent HPV infections. The book explores these women’s efforts to be good mothers and strong young women entering adulthood who felt vulnerable in sexual health negotiation. As a result, Making Gender reveals how vaccine decision-making took an ontological form, as an inherently social and cultural process embedded in women’s experiences.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson correctly predicted the euro would prove a calamity. They are right today that the euro crisis is far from over. Their demand for a radical change of approach must be taken seriously—by policy makers and politicians alike.”—Ed Balls, UK Shadow Chancellor from 2011 to 2015   “[The book] offers useful insight into why so many people thought the euro was a good idea in the first place.”—Harvard Business Review  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

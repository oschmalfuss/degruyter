More than a hundred self-guided field trips on six islands will inspire you to get outdoors and explore nature on your own.In Wind, Wings, and Waves, you'll find a knowledgeable and good-humored friend telling fascinating insider facts on this magical place: How, when, and where you can listen to whales singing. Where to see unique Hawaiian plants and birds. Why coral reefs are teeming with weird, wonderful life forms, and the best reefs to visit. Why Hawai‘i is the best place in the world for stargazing. How Hawai‘i became a melting pot of cultures and cuisines, including a mini-guide to the unique foods of the islands. How volcanoes make new Hawaiian islands, and the forces that make these islands travel and eventually disappear. How plants and animals made their way to the most isolated place on the planet, and what makes Hawai‘i a natural laboratory for evolution. The amazing story of Polynesian voyagers who navigated to Hawai‘i by the stars.By sharing his love for the natural wonders of Hawai‘i, biologist Rick Soehren helps you make the most of your time in the islands, whether you are having the vacation of a lifetime or lucky enough to live in Hawai‘i.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

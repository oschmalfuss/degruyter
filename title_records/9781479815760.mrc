Shared parishes remain one of the few institutionsin American society that allows cultural groups to maintain their own languageand customs while still engaging in regular intercultural negotiationsover the sharedspace.Thisbook explores the shared parish through an in-depth ethnographic study of aRoman Catholic parish in a small Midwestern city demographically transformed byMexican immigration in recent decades. Through its depiction of shared parishlife, the book argues for new ways of imagining the U.S. Catholic parish as anorganization. The parish, argues Brett C. Hoover, must be conceived as botha congregation and part of a centralized system, and as onepiece in a complex social ecology. The Shared Parish alsoposits that the search for identity and adequate intercultural practice in suchparishes might call fornew approaches to cultural diversity in U.S. society, beyond assimilation ormulticulturalism. We must imagine a religious organization that accommodatesboth the need for safe space within distinct groups and for social networksthat connect these groups as they struggle to respectfully co-exist.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

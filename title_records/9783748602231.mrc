From the basic principle underlying the coil coatings process to substrate preparation, selection of raw materials, coil coatings line equipment, performance testing and research topics through to standardisation. A noteworthy section of the book looks at applicaion areas involving cans and buildings. It also covers the diverse application procedures and their drying as well as wet spraying, powder coatings, UV-hardening, IR and EB. The major research findings on functional coatings and nanotechnology are included. To provide a solid grounding in all the imoortant principles of coil coatings - essential for the successful development of can and coil coatings. Jörg Sander writes this book for formulators seeking to stay abreast of the last developments in can and coil coatings as well as immersing themselves in the topic, along with experts looking for detailied information about surface preparation, materials, application, standardisation and test methods. Anyone involved in the coil coating manufacturing process who needs a full understanding of the relationships involved.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

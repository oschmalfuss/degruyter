The introductions to the volume and each record provide guidance on whether the men in each list were eligible or whether they served. The editor notes that the lists raise many other question. What proportion of the men balloted to serve in the militia did so? How many found substitutes? Where did substitutes come from? How long did recruits stay with militia units? When and why did they leave? Indeed, one document from the Civil War period lists men who ran away before they were clothed or armed.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

This book presents international projects which document the complexity of the task, from the design of the floor plans, the development and use of resources, to the use of economically beneficial building systems.  aIn view of the growing number of diverse life styles, the search for flexible, adaptable floor plans has become a fundamental issue in residential building. That the continued demand in urban centres can only be responsibly satisfied by high-density housing is undisputed. More than ever before, building high-density housing is a diverse and challenging task for planners and architects. This book presents international projects which document the complexity of the task, from the design of the floor plans, the development and use of resources, to the use of economically beneficial building systems. The high quality of the architecture and construction in such residential areas can be clearly seen in the uniform illustrations of the floor plans, and large-scale drawings of details. The introductory contributions discuss extensively the topic of floor plan design and development. This book is a comprehensive review of the current state of residential building, the perspectives and future developments.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

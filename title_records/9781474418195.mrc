Unique in establishing itself as the only female-run intellectual weekly in the golden age of the weekly review, Time and Tide both challenged persistent prejudices against women’s participation in public life and played an instrumental role in redefining women’s gender roles and identities. Drawing on extensive new archival research Catherine Clay recovers the contributions to this magazine of both well-and lesser-known British women writers, editors, critics, and journalists and explores a cultural dialogue about literature, politics and the arts that took place beyond the parameters of modernist ‘little magazines’. The book makes a major contribution to the history of women’s writing and feminism in Britain between the wars.Key FeaturesThe first in-depth study, based on extensive new archival research, of the richest two decades of this landmark feminist magazineShows how this female-run periodical secured a position among the leading general-audience intellectual weeklies of the day by tracing its close interdependence, and competition, within a changing set of interwar periodical structures and networksRecovers the contributions to this magazine of both well-known and undeservedly forgotten British women writers and criticsExplores a cultural dialogue about literature, politics and the arts that took place beyond the parameters of modernist ‘little magazines’ and mass-market periodicals  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

The era of wholehearted support for European unity was limited to the immediate postwar era. The stances of the past three U.S. presidents—Bush’s unilateralism, Obama’s insistence on “leading from behind,” and Trump’s overt hostility toward the European Union—were prefigured by Washington’s economic and geopolitical strategies of the 1960s and 1970s. Concentrating on the policies of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, Klaus Larres argues that their years in office were the major turning point when “benign hegemony” gave way to an attitude toward Europe that was seldom better than lukewarm, frequently even outright hostile, and that was returned in kind. This book offers an unusually clear and comprehensive examination of transatlantic relations during the Nixon era.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

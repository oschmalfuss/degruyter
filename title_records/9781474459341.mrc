I was like “no, of course not”. Dreamland. No way. … That's how it was throughout all of high school. I was like “of course, that would be ridiculous to be an artist. What?!”’ – ‘Mona’, illustrator‘Some families are dealing with the experience of growing up in the diaspora, which tends to make them look for the financial security of their children as a priority. So they might be fine with a daughter studying engineering or dentistry, but if she expressed a wish to go to art college instead then they’d discourage that strongly.’ – Deeyah Khan, film and magazine producer, two times Emmy Award Winner, Two times Peabody Award Winner, and BAFTA Award Winner.‘There's certain things I did at art college which weren't right, Islamically weren't right, like life drawing for example. You know, drawing nude men, that wasn't right really. But at that time, it was like, ‘well I'm doing it, I'm at art college, fine’. Whereas in hindsight now, I shouldn't really have done that.’ – ‘Fatimah’, Fine and Textile artist‘I think it's difficult for people of colour, I think it's difficult for women probably compared for men, and I think it's difficult for working class people. It is an elite world and some of it is about who your contacts are, who your connections are, who you know. It's very opaque.’ – Zarah Hussain, visual artist and winner of Lumen Prize 2017 People’s Choice AwardMuslim women are opening up new educational and career pathways across the UK, pioneering roles in digital media, fashion design and visual art. However, their contributions to the economy and culture are rarely the focus of media and government reports. Now, Saskia Warren draws on in-depth fieldwork with British Muslim women working in these roles, taking a narrative approach to look at how they frame their own everyday labour experiences.Drawing on interviews, focus groups, activity diaries, and online digital and visual analysis, Warren brings these women's voices to the forefront to explore how Muslim womanhood is variously celebrated, contested, resisted and subverted. From negotiating family expectations to encountering prejudice from education providers and employers, and from founding businesses to finding ways to respect religion in their creative work, these personal insights bring the struggles and successes of British Muslim women creatives to life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

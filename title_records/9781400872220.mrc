His idol was Theodore Roosevelt, whom he served while head of the United States Forest Service and whom he emulated when he was chief executive of Pennsylvania. This first published biography (except for his autobiography) of a colorful and crusading figure covers Pinchot's entire career in his two roles as conservationist and politician.Originally published in 1960.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Altarpieces and panels were produced for the home market, but also for export; the sculptures have a distinctive style, dictated by the religious subjects and by the material, and were usually painted and gilded. At the Reformation, such items were hidden or destroyed, and it is the survival of numerous continental examples, particularly in France, together with the remaining examples from England, that enables the history of alabaster carving to be documented. This book catalogues some 2,400 carvings, with their location and published references, coupled with a Geographical Index. It is the fullest catalogue yet compiled on these exquisite small-scale sculptures, incorporating much new information, particularly relating to the iconography of the carvings. Thelate FRANCIS CHEETHAM was also the author of English Medieval Alabasters, containing a catalogue of the collection in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

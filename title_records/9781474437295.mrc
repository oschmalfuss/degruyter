The importance of Channel 4 to the British film industry over the last 40 years cannot be overstated. The birth of the Channel in 1982 heralded a convergence between the UK film and television sectors which was particularly notable given that the two industries had historically been at loggerheads. In addition to its role as a broadcaster and curator of feature film programming, since its inception Channel 4 has funded or co-funded hundreds of feature films through its film commissioning arm, Film4. The Channel’s commitment to financing between 15-20 films per year helped form the backbone of the ailing film sector throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, while Film4 funding has also been instrumental to the success of many companies which have become vital to the British film industry.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

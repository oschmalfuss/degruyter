This book is designed to draw the user's attention to the hazards that are known to exist and to suggest how they can be minimized. It brings together published material as well as many instances that have been reported or observed. A considerable number of these misadventures arise from inherent weaknesses in the construction of the equipment. Others result from confusing variations in the items abailable from different manufacturers and countries. Not only does the identification of vital parts and controls very, but parts which should be interchangeable often or not, whereas others are described as being interchangeable when, in fact, they should never be fitted together. The subject is discussed in a gas flow sequence, starting with the source of anaesthetic gases as they are conveyed by pipelines to the anaesthetic machine and ending at the patient's trachea. This unique and important book should be required reading for designers, manufacturers, and maintenance personnel as well as anaesthetists.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

His work bears unique witness to an empire struggling at once toward traditional and transformation, the old Rome of Augustus and the new Rome of Christ. Embodied within Ammianus's history is a universally admired spirit of independence that has, however, led to a steady denaturing of the historian's personal commitment to particular causes. At the hands of modern critics, Ammianus frequently seems to lose his character, and his frequently seems to lose his character, and his religion too vanishes. Rike reconstructs Ammianus's religion from the beginning and concludes that he was an enthusiastic pagan whose firm commitment to traditional beliefs cannot be understood without changing our usual conceptions of late Roman religion. Rike's study widens our too narrowly philosophical sense of paganism; the historian's striving will remind us of the vital spiritual continuum which joined the ages of Augustus and Constantine. Accordingly, this book should itself serve as a useful bridge between students of Late Antiquity and traditional classicists.

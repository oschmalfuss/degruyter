This book investigates the origins and evolution of the main institutions of Scottish education, bringing together a range of scholars, each an expert on his or her own period, and with interests including – but also ranging beyond – the history of education.From the medieval period to the modern, this book provides a broad picture of Scottish educational history, while also highlighting the particularities and varieties of the Scottish system through the ages: from monastic to secular; from rural to urban; from Latin to Gaelic; from Reformation to Enlightenment and beyond.This is a hugely important reference work for historians and students of education within and beyond Scotland, and essential background reading for teachers and policy-makers. It is also a significant book for anyone interested in the development of modern Scotland, its culture and institutions.Key FeaturesThe first multi-authored history of education in Scotland that covers the whole of its medieval and modern historyAn unrivalled group of historians and social scientists with extensive expertise in Scottish historySets new agendas for the future of historical research in ScotlandContributorsDavid Allan is a Reader in Scottish History at the University of St Andrews.Robert Anderson is Professor Emeritus of Modern History, University of Edinburgh.

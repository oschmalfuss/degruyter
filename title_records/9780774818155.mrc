Historians have consequently tended to overlook the experiences of women entrepreneurs. Who were these women, and how were they able to justify their work outside the home? The Business of Women explores the world of women entrepreneurs in early twentieth-century British Columbia. Contrary to expectation, the typical businesswoman was not unmarried or particularly rebellious, but a woman who reconciled entrepreneurship with her femininity and her identity as a wife, mother, or widow. The entrepreneurial woman was the product of a frontier ethos in British Columbia that translated into higher rates of marriage for women and more married women working outside the home than in any other province in Canada. Like men, they worked to support their families.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Now in its fifth edition, it remains the fundamental reference for students as well as for diagnosticians—a usable, comprehensive key to plant-parasitic nematodes and the only guide to feature both photographs and drawings.Accompanied by full-page plates, the book offers descriptions of 68 genera, including most that have one or more species known to be plant parasites. The bibliography of approximately 2,500 entries on the taxonomy and morphology of nematode genera is one of the fullest on this subject.For the present edition, the authors have made revisions throughout and have added references to more than two hundred genera not previously included. An updated taxonomy, glossary, and an index are also provided.William F. Mai is Liberty Hyde Bailey Emeritus professor, Peter G. Mullin is Coordinator of Laboratory Instruction, and Howard H. Lyon is Biological Photographer (retired) in the Department of Plant Pathology, Cornell University.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

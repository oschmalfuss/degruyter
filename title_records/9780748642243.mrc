This book offers a comprehensive account of the policy process in contemporary Scotland. There is a review of theories of policy-making, focusing on decentralised systems. The author then identifies the key actors and institutions, patterns of policy making, and the extent of convergence and divergence in comparison with England and other devolved territories.Case studies of policy making in health, higher education, housing, criminal justice, social inclusion and economic development allow the reader to see how policy making works in practice. There is an analysis of financial planning and decision making, and an examination of Scotland's role in UK and European policy networks. Comparisons are made with other devolved governments in Europe and beyond.The book is based on extensive research, including interviews with leaders of interest groups, politicians and officials across the Scottish Government and in the Scottish Parliament, an analysis of spending patterns, an examination of the legislative output, and case studies of policy making.Key FeaturesProvides the only comprehensive account of policy-making under devolution in ScotlandPlaces Scotland within a broader theoretical and comparative framework and analyses institutions and processes of policy-makingContains case studies of specific policy fields and a thorough treatment of financial questionsEmphasis is placed on Scotland's insertion into UK, European and international networksMichael Keating is Professor of Politics at the University of Aberdeen and was previously Professor at the European University Institute, Florence.

But between Expo 86 and the Olympic Games in 2010, something extraordinary happened. This otherwise unremarkable city underwent a radical transformation that saw it emerge as an inspiring world-class metropolis celebrated for its livability, sustainability, and competitiveness. City-watchers everywhere took notice and wanted to learn more about this new model of urban growth, and the term “Vancouverism” was born. This book tells the story of Vancouverism and the urban planning philosophy and practice behind it. The author is a former chief planner of the City of Vancouver and was a key player at the heart of the action. Writing from an insider’s perspective, Larry Beasley traces the principles that inspired Vancouverism and the policy framework developed to implement it. The prologue, written by Vancouver journalist Frances Bula, outlines the political and urban history of Vancouver up until the 1980s. The text is also beautifully illustrated by the author with more than 200 colour photographs. Cities everywhere are asking the same question. Shall we shape change or will change shape us? This book shows how one city discovered positive answers, and it offers the principles, tools, and inspiration for others to follow.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

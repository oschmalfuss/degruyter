It is also an area that suffered from rural de-population during the first half of the twentieth century. Against the background of social, economic and political change in the twentieth century, the book provides a detailed account of continuity and change in the practice of town and country planning in the Scottish Borders from the 1940s to the re-organisation of local government in 1996. It shows how town and country planning emerged from being a fringe activity in Borders local government to become a beacon for rural regeneration at the forefront of rural development policy. This book will be an essential read for all those interested in the history of town and country planning in Scotland and for those who love the Scottish Borders.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

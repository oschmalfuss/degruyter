But the lessons learned apply beyond these groups--to all modern organizations, for-profit and non-profit, that are dealing with the complicated conditions of the twenty-first century.Leadership is a learned skill and can be acquired by anyone willing to make the effort, say the authors. And, through case studies of a variety of organizations, they emphasize that all members of productive groups must be ready to take the lead when their specific skills are most relevant to the problem at hand. The authors analyze how organizations and individuals can adopt this new leadership mode, and they discuss the results of a recent survey of leadership ideas and attitudes among active environmental leaders. Shifting emphasis away from celebrated leaders on the world stage, Gordon and Berry focus on “essential” leadership-the kind that engages each member of an organization on an everyday basis.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

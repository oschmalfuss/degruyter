It is self-contained, requiring only a knowledge of the calculus. The material is presented in a simple and understandable but rigorous manner, accompanied by many examples which illustrate the ideas, methods, and results. The use of tensors is explained in detail, not omitting little formal tricks which are useful in their applications. Though never formalistic, it provides an introduction to Riemannian geometry. The theory of curves and surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space is presented in a modern way, and applied to various classes of curves and surfaces which are of practical interest in mathematics and its applications to physical, cartographical, and engineering problems. Considerable space is given to explaining and illustrating basic concepts such as curve, arc length, surface, fundamental forms; covariant and contravariant vectors; covariant, contravariant and mixed tensors, etc. Interesting problems are included and complete solutions are given at the end of the book, together with a list of the more important formulae. No pains have been spared in constructing suitable figures.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Uncovering the person behind the persona, M. Hakan Yavuz draws on 250 first-hand interviews to untangle the web of literary, religious and biographical influences that shaped Erdogan’s personality, ideology and world view. In understanding the inner life, continuous self-reinvention and professional struggles of Erdoğan, Yavuz is able to provide an invaluable insight into the complex record of policies – in both domestic and international arenas – that have marked his governing tenure. With chapters covering the Gezi park protests, the clash between the AKP and Gülen movement, the Kurdish question and the country’s projected image as a major international power, Yavuz explores how and why Erdoğan has reconstituted a ‘New Turkey’ – a hybrid political entity, neither East nor West, democratic nor dictatorial, Islamic nor secular.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

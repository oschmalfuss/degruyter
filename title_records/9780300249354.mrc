Originally from a remote village on the northwest border of Greece, Ganás witnessed the Greek Civil War as a young child, and was taken into enforced exile in Eastern Europe with his family. Weaving together subtle references to the events and places that have defined his life's story, Ganás's terse and technically accomplished poems are a combination of folklore, autobiography, and recent history. Whether describing the mountains of his youth or the difficulties of acclimation in Athens of the 1960s and 1970s, Ganás's writing is infused with striking and original imagery inspired by love, memory, and loss.   Featuring expert translations-made in collaboration with Ganás himself-by David Connolly and Joshua Barley, this volume also includes a scholarly introduction to the poet's life and work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

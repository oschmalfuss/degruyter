Excavations were conducted from 1986 to 1991 as an American-Greek collaboration directed by Philip P. Betancourt and Costis Davaras. The Plateia Building (Building BS/BV) is located at the north of the Town Square or Plateia. It occupies the entire northern side of the square, with one room built on the eastern side as well. The structure is the largest building excavated at Pseira. The building was discovered by small tests made in 1986, and it was excavated in subsequent seasons. From the beginning, the building was recognized as an important structure in the town. Its excavation was conducted slowly and meticulously, with careful attention to the proper recovery and recording of its data.University Museum Monograph, 102  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

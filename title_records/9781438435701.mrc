[A] major contribution and starting point for an important conversation." Choice"Gürüz's book is a powerful and remarkably comprehensive work dealing with a wide array of interconnected topics and complex data relating to globalization and international student mobility. . . . Higher Education and International Student Mobility in the Global Knowledge Economy is a wonderful read on many levels and clearly represents decades of careful data analysis and synthesis."

Cardoso began his career struggling to apply Marxist ideas to political realities, and he continues to acknowledge the Marxist element that persists in his thinking. Nevertheless, since his election to Brazil’s presidency in 1994, he has been a vigorous advocate of free markets and privatization. Ted Goertzel traces Cardoso’s life and intellectual development, describing his childhood in a supportive political family, his university days and years in exile, his involvement in democratic politics in Brazil, and finally his remarkable record as president. An insightful illustration of one individual’s transition from the academy to politics and policymaking, Goertzel’s astute biography also provides an excellent overview of the issues that have occupied Brazil and the region for decades.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

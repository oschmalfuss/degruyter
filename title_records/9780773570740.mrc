The region is thus torn between its memory of an earlier, more traditional social order and its present experience as a modern industrial society. These tensions are embedded in the Maritime character and have affected not only the lives of its people but the imaginations and texts of its writers. The stories of Thomas Raddall, Hugh MacLennan, Charles Bruce, Ernest Buckler, Alden Nowlan, Alistair MacLeod, Donna Smyth, Budge Wilson, and David Adams Richards have been deeply influenced by the cultural shifts they have observed. In the last two decades a host of new literary voices has emerged, and Creelman also explores the works of such writers as Ann-Marie MacDonald, Lynn Coady, Nancy Bauer, Deborah Joy Corey, Carol Bruneau, Alan Wilson, Leo McKay, and Sheldon Currie. He shows that these Maritime artists share a common regional identity that shapes their narratives as they find their own paths through the tensions which envelop them.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

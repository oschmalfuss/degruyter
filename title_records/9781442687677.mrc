The fourth and final volume of the Collected Works of George Grant contains his writings from the last period of his life and includes unpublished material such as lectures, interviews, and excerpts from his notebooks. With comprehensive annotations for his articles, reviews, and the three books he published during this period - Time as History, English-Speaking Justice, and Technology and Justice - the volume also contains his writings on Nietzsche, Heidegger Simone Weil, and Céline that were central to this phase of his thought. Volume 4 reveals his engagement with technology and the nature of technological society that is as insightful today as during Grant's lifetime and is lasting proof of his legacy. Arthur Davis is Associate Professor in the School of Social Sciences, Atkinson Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies, York University. During the 1950's, he studied undergraduate philosophy with George Grant.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

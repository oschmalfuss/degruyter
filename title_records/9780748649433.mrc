This largely untold and fascinating history not only illuminates a significant lacuna in Scots contemporary history, but also brings considerable nuance and regional comparative element to the now burgeoning scholarship of the contemporary history of sexuality in Britain. … This is an indispensable volume in the historiography of sexualities in Britain, and should be valued by all working in this field.' – Sean Brady, Social History of Medicine, July 2013In exploring the role of the state in the regulation of modern sexuality, historians have largely overlooked the policy-making process in Scotland. Davidson and Davis lead us through the Scottish sexual landscape leading up to the global crisis of HIV/AIDS, analysing post-war state policy towards issues such as abortion, family planning, homosexuality, pornography, prostitution, sex education and sexual heath. How progressive were Scottish policy makers during this period of rapid social change? The book charts the ongoing struggle between progressive and moralistic agendas within sexual politics at both a national and local level. How far did the puritanical elements of Scottish Presbyterianism continue to inhibit policy and to what degree did policy makers empower a broader range of sexual behaviours and moderate the traditional surveillance and censure of female sexuality? Finally, in what respects did Scotland's national identity affect the engagement of the Scottish state with sexual issues?Key FeaturesAdds an important Scottish perspective to the study of sexuality and policy-making in modern society. There are few resources for the student of Scotland's sexual history and its political and social context.Provides a significant addition to the history of sexuality in 20th-century BritainMakes a significant contribution to our understanding of the later 20th-century Scottish state, and especially the local stateAdds to our knowledge of the shaping of policy on key issues relating to sexual morality in modern society including abortion, censorship, family planning, homosexuality, prostitution, sex education, and sexually transmitted diseases"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

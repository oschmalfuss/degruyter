It is intended for graduate students in mathematics and for researchers working in academia and industry. The focus on stochastic models in discrete time has two immediate benefits. First, the probabilistic machinery is simpler, and one can discuss right away some of the key problems in the theory of pricing and hedging of financial derivatives. Second, the paradigm of a complete financial market, where all derivatives admit a perfect hedge, becomes the exception rather than the rule. Thus, the need to confront the problems arising in incomplete financial market models appears at a very early stage. The first part of the book studies a simple one-period model which serves as a building stone for later developments. Topics include the characterisation of arbitrage-free markets, the representation of preferences on asset profiles by expected utility theory and its robust extensions, monetary measures of risk, and an introduction to equilibrium analysis. In the second part, the idea of dynamic hedging of contingent claims is developed in a multi-period framework. Such models are typically incomplete: They involve intrinsic risks which cannot be hedged away completely. Topics include martingale measures, pricing formulas for derivatives, American options, superhedging, and hedging strategies with minimal shortfall risk. Markets are modeled on general probability spaces. Thus, the text captures the interplay between probability theory and functional analysis which has been crucial for recent advances in mathematical finance.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

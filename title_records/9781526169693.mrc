One of its most distinctive features was the way in which for much of the period under review – for expedient reasons – Puritanism in this region was backed, rather than persecuted, by the ecclesiastical and civil authorities as a bulwark against entrenched Roman Catholicism. The ongoing struggles between Puritanism and Roman Catholicism are systematically documented, partly by means of parish case studies. The respective, interlocking roles of puritan clergy, laity and patrons are carefully considered. Lay activism and gender dynamics receive extended treatment; there is much here on Puritanism’s inner momentum and on women’s history. The educational background of the clergy, especially their shared university experience, is analysed, as are the reading habits of clergy and laity alike.Though much further research on Puritanism has taken place since 1972, the approach adopted in this study and its findings retain their validity and relevance.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

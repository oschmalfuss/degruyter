Patterned in bold black and white geometric designs streaked with scintillating dashes of yellow, these robes predate the better known Chilkat dancing blankets from the same area. Today only eleven of these robes exist, three of them as fragments. Another two are shown on Russian historical paintings by Mikhail Tikhanov. The only other known robes are found on an archival photograph and on two sketches by Pavel Mikhailof. To produce this book, Cheryl Samuel travelled to Leningrad, Copenhagen, and London to examine the six robes in Europe. She also studied the robes housed in museums in Canada and the United States. In 1985, she reconstructed Chief Kotlean's robe, using information she had gathered from her study of the actual robes and Tikhanov's paintings. In the process, she resurrected an old weaving style no longer used by the Native people on the northern coast. Through her extensive and careful research, Cheryl Samuel makes an important contribution to the knowledge of early Indian weaving.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

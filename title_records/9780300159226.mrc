Laurence Lampert’s chapter-by-chapter commentary on Nietzsche’s magnum opus clarifies not only Zarathustra’s narrative structure but also the development of Nietzsche’s thinking as a whole.“An impressive piece of scholarship. Insofar as it solves the riddle of Zarathustra in an unprecedented fashion, this study serves as an invaluable resource for all serious students of Nietzsche’s philosophy. Lampert’s persuasive and thorough interpretation is bound to spark a revival of interest in Zarathustra and raise the standards of Nietzsche scholarship in general.”—Daniel W. Conway, Review of Metaphysics“A book of scholarship, filled with passion and concern for its text.”—Tracy B. Strong, Review of Politics“This is the first genuine textual commentary on Zarathustra in English, and therewith a genuine reader’s guide. It makes a significant and original contribution to its field.”—Werner J. Dannhauser, Cornell University“This is a very valuable and carefully wrought study of a very complex and subtle poetic-philosophical work that provides access to Nietzsche’s style of presenting his thought, as well as to his passionately affirmed values. Lampert’s commentary and analysis of Zarathustra is so thorough and detailed. . . that it is the most useful English-language companion to Nietzsche’s ‘edifying’ and intriguing work.”—ChoiceSelected as one of Choice’s outstanding academic books for 1988  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

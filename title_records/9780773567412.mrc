Family Names of the Island of Newfoundland traces the origins of almost 3,000 surnames found on the Island and provides an engaging and comprehensive collection of etymology, genealogy, and Newfoundland history. The introduction presents a fascinating discussion of the history and linguistic origins of surnames found in Newfoundland, which come from many different cultures, notably English, Welsh, Irish, Scottish, French, Syrian, Lebanese, and Mi'kmaq. The main body of the book comprises a dictionary of surnames in the province based on data collected from provincial voting lists, family records, government documents, and newspaper reports dating back to the seventeenth century. Each entry includes variant spellings and cross-references of the surname, the countries in which the name originated, and its meaning. Newfoundland place names associated with the surname are also given. The book also includes a ranking of the most common surnames in Newfoundland and a comparative analysis of the frequency of surnames in Scotland, Ireland, England, and Newfoundland. Originally published in 1977, Family Names of the Island of Newfoundland is a unique reference work, giving Newfoundlanders, both in the province and away, a fascinating look at their roots. This edition incorporates a number of additions and corrections and has been completely reset in a sturdier and more convenient format. It will be of great use to individuals tracing their ancestors and to genealogists researching early settlers in Newfoundland.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

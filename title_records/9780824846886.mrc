There are dance-dramas, ballets, masked pantomimes, operas, operettas, shadow-plays, puppet-plays, and more. You will see not only actors and actresses, but elegant and exquisitely costumed court dancers, musicians, singers, and chanters. You will hear songs and heroic narratives and flights of poetic dialogue. Drums will thud and gongs will boom. Everywhere you go, the colors, sights, and sounds will vary enormously from place to place.But it is not easy to discover where theaters are, what types of plays are being staged, or the hours, days, and seasons of performance. The purpose of this Guide is to help the traveler in Asia find and enjoy exciting living theater. The author's personal experience and knowledge of theater in Asia will be an indispensable resource to the traveler who cares about theater, but knows little about Asia.Brandon describes and evaluates the many theatrical forms, itemizing in detail the festival or theater seasons and locations and types of theater buildings. The Guide also lists theater street addresses, phone numbers, best route to the theater, hours and days of performances, best and worst seats in the house, and times and places to buy tickets. Noted also is whether the theatergoer should bring a blanket, a folding chair, or a snack—or plan on a gourmet dinner in any one of several restaurants in a deluxe theater complex. Approximate prices (in each local currency) are given for tickets, taxis, meals, programs, etc. For each country there is a list of relevant books to read before, or upon, arrival; for each city there is a list of local newspapers, theater guides, and other sources of information.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

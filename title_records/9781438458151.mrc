As the founder and publisher of Dan's Papers, a weekly community newspaper, Rattiner knows the Hamptons backwards and forwards, and stories of his encounters on the South Fork of Long Island give readers a greater understanding of how this community has changed over the years and the major figures who have shepherded these changes along.In addition to well-known faces such as Dr. Oz and billionaires like Ira Rennert and his wife—who built the second-largest private home in America—you'll also read about motel owners, art gallery owners, an ad salesman for Dan's Papers, and a philanthropist who at one time had nearly a dozen historical buildings on her $100 million property in East Hampton. The book also provides some of the hoaxes and tall tales that the author has fabricated over the years to entertain the readers of Dan's Papers, including the moving radar tower at Montauk, the great Ecuadorian eel attack, and the Hamptons subway."Dan's book, as does his newspaper, creates a chronicle of the women and men who have chosen to live in this magical place over these different decades, so one gets a very personal picture of how it was and is. Dan's seen it all and isn't keeping it under his very real hat." — from the Foreword by Barbara L.

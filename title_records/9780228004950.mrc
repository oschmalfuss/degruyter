Bringing together leading political scientists and media scholars, the book examines the strategies, successes, and failures of each of Canada's major political parties, with special attention given to the pressing question of climate change. In Canadian elections, the context of the campaign is vital. Here, contributors consider in detail the way public opinion polls were reported leading up to the election, how traditional media portrayed events, why the electorate waited to make up their minds, and the means by which social media dealt with fears of a disinformation wave. The book uses data to identify the important factors in determining the voting behaviour of Canadians in 2019 and the ways these factors combined to produce a minority Liberal government. The Canadian Federal Election of 2019 is the essential resource for every interested political observer wanting to dissect the last election and required reading to prepare for the next one.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

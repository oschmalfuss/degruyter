For this new edition, David R. Mayhew has provided a new Preface, a new appendix, and a new concluding chapter that brings the historical narrative up to date.“Important, accessible, and compelling, David Mayhew’s second edition of Divided We Govern takes the best book on the history of US lawmaking and-against all odds-makes it better.”-Keith Krehbiel, Stanford University“In this welcome updating of his agenda-setting classic, David Mayhew cogently defends his original methodology and finds that divided government remains no less productive of important legislation than unified government, although it is now (thanks mainly to Clinton’s impeachment) strongly associated with prominent investigations of the executive branch. Written with Mayhew’s usual clarity and grace, this is a book to be enjoyed by beginning and veteran students of Congress alike.”-Gary JacobsonFrom reviews of the first edition:"First-rate. . . . Mayhew’s tabulations and analysis are, quite simply, unimpeachable."-Morris Fiorina, Washington Monthly"Will stand for years as a classic."-L.

In addition to providing a panoramic, comprehensive study of Oz's work, including his novels, novellas, short stories, and numerous essays on literary, social, and political subjects, Mazor also meticulously documents the evolution of Oz's aesthetic and ideological vision. The book concludes with an extensive interview with Oz himself, in which he offers insights into his own work as well as the creative process in general.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

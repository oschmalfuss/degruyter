In the midst of this common commercial growth, North Africa and Europe also shared in a burst of spirituality and mysticism, instigating a Second Axial Age in the history of religion.Challenging the idea of a Mediterranean split between Islam and Christianity, the book shows how the Maghrib (North Africa) was not a Muslim, Arab monolith or an extension of the exotic Orient. Rather, medieval North Africa was as diverse and complex as Latin Europe. Instead of dismissing North Africa as a sideshow of European history, it should be seen as an integral part of the story.Key FeaturesShows how medieval Western European and North African history were part of a common Western Mediterranean cultureProvides a political, cultural and social history of the regionPrimarily based on personal biographies of remarkable Mediterranean travellers, scholars, rulers and historiansExamines key elements of this history: commerce, slavery, mercenary activity, art and intellectual and religious debates  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

In recent decades, however, the concept of citizenship has generated significant interest and intellectual debate in a variety of academic contexts. Globalization is changing the relationships between actors on the national and international stage and shifting the balance of power between them. These changes have spawned a wealth of scholarship across social science disciplines. The essays in Law and Citizenship add to this lively discourse and provide a framework for analyzing citizenship in an increasingly globalized world. A number of fundamental issues are addressed: How are traditional notions of citizenship erecting borders against those who are excluded? What are the impacts of changing notions of state, borders, and participation on our concepts of citizenship? Within territorial borders, to what extent are citizens able to participate, given that the principles of accountability, transparency, and representativeness remain ideals? There are numerous implications of the concept of citizenship for law and public policy in a number of different fields. International law, both private and public, poverty law, immigration law, constitutional law, history, political science, and sociology all reflect concepts of citizenship. Law and Citizenship will appeal to scholars and students in law and politics as well as those interested in the idea of citizenship in contemporary society.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

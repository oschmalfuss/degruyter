In 2012, the campaign did it again, further honing those marketing tools and demonstrating that political marketing is on the cutting edge when it comes to effective branding, advertising, and relationship-building. The challenges facing a presidential campaign may be unique to the political arena, but the creative solutions are not. The Marketing Revolution in Politics shows how recent US presidential campaigns have adopted the latest marketing techniques and how organizations in the for-profit and non-profit sectors can benefit from their example. Distilling the marketing practices of successful political campaigns down into seven key lessons, Bruce I. Newman shows how organizations of any size can apply the same innovative, creative, and cost-effective marketing tactics as today’s presidential hopefuls. A compelling study of marketing in the make-or-break world of American politics, this book should be a must-read for managers, students of marketing and political marketing, and anyone interested in learning more about how presidential campaigns operate. Winner of the 2016 International Book Award in the "Business: Marketing & Advertising" category.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

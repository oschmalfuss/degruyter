This is an event when you can't afford to make a mistake. Small business owners need basic guidance from someone who doesn't have a stake in the sale of their business. Moving On: Getting the Most from the Sale of Your Small Business is a straight forward, highly pragmatic discussion that will guide you through the sales process and help you avoid some of the common pitfalls faced by business owners that lack experience with the process. This book will assist you in finding the right professional help when you are ready. James F. Grebey, an operations management specialist who provides small business owners with insight into the sales process, helps you recognize pitfalls that could impact your sale negotiations. This book is replete with tips and tools that you will need to drive a successful sale of your business, such as writing the "book" used to market the business, and recommendations to create a working model with a dynamic (what if) spreadsheet to justify your sales projections. Readers will learn where to reach out for qualified professionals that can help with the sale process.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Uneven in quality, often highly personal, they offer important insights into the concerns and growth of the English novelist. Mr. Miller has provided a reference guide to the First volume of the three, analyzing the writings and the intellectual traditions in which Fielding worked. Included in Volume One are poetry, formal essays, a translation from the Greek, and several satirical sketches and Lucianic dialogues. Here is Fielding experimenting with literary styles; adumbrated here are many of the themes and methods of the later novels, Tom Jones and Amelia in particular. In recording Fielding's intense moral concerns, his comic genius, and his ironic, incisive portraits of man and society, Volume One of the Miscellanies is a microcosm of his intellectual world.Originally published in 1961.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

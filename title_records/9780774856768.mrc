Moiety and lineage, social rank, the rules of entitlement to inherited property, and the mode of thought encoded in mythology still have force in Haida society. Political action did not and does not take place within the context of formal political institutions; instead it exists through the management of the symbols of social relationships and of entitlement to tangible and intangible property. Drawing on models of practice theory and discursive action, Marianne Boelscher presents sets of data to illustrate collective and individual strategies for the management of symbols for social and political ends. She shows that the intentional ambiguity in the rhetoric surrounding group memberships and boundaries -- rank, kinship categories, marital alliances, names, and crests -- permits these symbols to be continuously renegotiated in discourse to meet these goals. The book is based on data collected by the author during extensive fieldwork with the Masset Haida during the late 1970s and early 1980s and on the evaluation of earlier ethnographic and ethnohistoric sources. The study shows that Haida cultural values and their expression in discourse have survived decades of oppression through white society. By providing the Haida perspective, the book enhances our understanding of important social issues, such as Haida land claims, that have vexed the Haida and Canadian nations for generations.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

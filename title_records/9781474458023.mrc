H. Lawrence established a professional writing careerRepresents a timely intervention into D. H. Lawrence studies, twentieth-century publishing practice and early modernist historiographyIncludes extensive new archival research which supplements the Cambridge University Press edition of the Letters and Works of D. H. LawrenceContributes to the recent expansion of scholarship on transatlantic modernism by considering the pre-WW1 literary marketplace in both Britain and AmericaExplores directions and methodologies for approaching a single author study through the lens of modern periodical studies and cultural historyDespite the ‘materialist turn’ in modernist studies, the extent and depth of D. H. Lawrence’s engagement with the literary marketplace has not been considered. The labelling of him as a working class ‘genius’ has concealed the question of how he became a published writer. Analysing the literary marketplace of the ‘long’ Edwardian period, this book assesses the circumstances for becoming an author at this time, examining Lawrence’s changing conceptions of what kind of writer he wanted to be and who he wanted to write for. It reconsiders the significance of Lawrence’s literary mentors Ford Madox Hueffer and Edward Garnett and recovers several figures (including Violet Hunt and Ezra Pound) whose significance for Lawrence’s career has been underestimated. The book evaluates how Lawrence’s work was marketed and received by the reading public in Britain and America, examining publishing houses (including Heinemann, Duckworth, T. Fisher Unwin and Mitchell Kennerley) and literary journals and magazines (such as the New Age, the English Review, Madame and Forum).  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

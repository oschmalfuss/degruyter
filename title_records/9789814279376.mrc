For the first time, this book also reveals the full extent to which Myanmar has challenged the solidarity and development of ASEAN itself. This is a must read for anyone interested in either Myanmar or the future of Southeast Asia." - Maung Zarni, Research Fellow on Burma at the LSE Centre for Global Governance, London School of Economics and Political Science; Founder, Free Burma Coalition "This is the first comprehensive study of the tensions for ASEAN’s security community concept arising from Myanmar's membership of ASEAN. Too much commentary about Myanmar is agenda-driven; this study is objective, meticulously researched, and finely balanced. Being an 'outsider', Christopher Roberts recognizes the dynamics that characterize these complex relationships, and analyses them with care and insight." – Trevor Wilson, former Australian Ambassador to Myanmar (2000-03); Visiting Fellow, Australian National University, Canberra "The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has set itself the goal of creating an ASEAN Security Community by 2015. This book is a highly original empirical study of instability in Myanmar and its transnational impact set within the framework of the security community theory. Roberts advances innovative policy proposals aimed at addressing Myanmar's human security issues in order to improve governance and the capacity for reform. This book will be the required reading for academics and policy-makers as the process of constructing a regional security community unfolds." – Carlyle A.

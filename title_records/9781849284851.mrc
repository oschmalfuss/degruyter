To benefit fully from the framework, companies have to look at the relationships between processes, understanding upstream and downstream impacts. However, advice on using this approach has not been readily available … until now. Manage ITIL like never before Practical, sensible and sound advice from industry experts The authors bring together their extensive practical experience to provide a guide written for IT professionals, ITSM practitioners, Service Owners and Process Owners, university students, and in fact anyone working to adopt the ITIL framework or needing a deeper understanding of its interfaces.

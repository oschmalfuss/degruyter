Though his career spanned merely twelve years, his impact and influence was profoundly felt; Chatwin’s first book In Patagonia ‘redefined travel writing’, whilst his later work The Songlines became one of the literary sensations of the 1980s. Incorporating original and extensive archival research, as well as new interviews with his family and friends, Anywhere out of the world provides the definitive critical perspective upon the literary life and work of this enigmatic and influential author. The work offers a chronological overview of Chatwin’s literary career, from his first, ultimately aborted work The Nomadic Alternative – here discussed in detail for the first time – through to his final novel Utz. In subjecting his work to such analysis, the study uncovers a striking thematic commonality in Chatwin’s oeuvre: his work is fundamentally preoccupied with the subject of human restlessness. This volume provides detailed insight into Chatwin’s treatment of the subject in his work, identifying and discussing the biographical and philosophical sources of this defining preoccupation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

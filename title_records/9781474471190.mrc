And what would be the consequences, for Scotland and the rest of the UK? Independence is ever-present on the Scottish political agenda. This book is the first serious study of the likely road to independence, and the consequences for the Scottish people and the Scottish economy. Scottish Independence starts with a detailed guide to the stages along the route to independence and goes on to analyse the legal, political and economic consequences. It asks key questions:If Scots vote for an SNP government in Edinburgh, how will that government deliver its manifesto promise of achieving independence in Scotland?If the Scots attain independence, what will change? What will Scotland's place be in the world? Can Scotland remain in the EU?What are the economics of independence? Would there be a flight of capital and a stock-market fall? How much economic freedom would an independent Scotland have?How much would change in the daily lives of Scots as a result of independence? How much autonomy would Scotland have as a small independent state in Europe?Scottish Independence will have an impact on public policy and on academic thinking, and is of key interest to politicians, civil servants, academics, journalists and anyone interested in Scotland's future.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

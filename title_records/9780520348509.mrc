This detailed treatise will appeal to those with an interest in world politics and economics, especially that of Europe and the aftermath of The Great War. John Atkinson Hobson (1858 – 1940) was an English social scientist and economist most famous for his work on imperialism—which notably had an influence on Vladimir Lenin—as well as his theory of underconsumption. His early work also questioned the classical theory of rent and predicted the Neoclassical "marginal productivity" theory of distribution. Other notable works by this author include: “Evolution of Modern Capitalism” (1894), “Problem of the Unemployed” (1896), and “John Ruskin: Social Reformer” (1898). Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. It is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition together with an excerpt from “Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism” by V. I. Lenin.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

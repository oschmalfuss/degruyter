Costs and benefits of a universal visa policy, the distinction between refugees and immigrants, the role of the provinces, and the relationship between immigration and demographic issues are considered in depth. Dirks also pays particular attention to the structure of the organization. Bringing his study into this decade, he concludes by focusing on 1993 amendments to the Immigration Act. Throughout Dirks demonstrates that economic factors, while playing a major role in immigration policy, have not always been the most important consideration. He argues convincingly that social and political factors, as well as structural, organizational and bureaucratic considerations, have had a pivotal impact on both the content and the implementation of policy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Despite this seemingly positive shift, gender inequality remains deeply rooted in the US. Good Guys, Bad Guys delves into this paradox, unraveling the complexities of men’s feminist allyship and its limitations in propelling genuine progress.Emily K. Carian masterfully dissects the narratives of two distinct groups of gender activists: feminist men and men who belong to the men's rights movement, which opposes feminism. By engaging directly with the men themselves, Carian constructs a compelling analysis of their journeys into these contrasting social movements.Surprisingly, Carian finds that both feminist men and men’s rights activists share a common motivation for their engagement in gender activism: the desire to be perceived as “good men.” However, this well-intentioned yet superficial drive hinders feminist men from envisioning concrete and effective strategies to challenge gender inequality. Conversely, it fuels men’s rights activists’ participation in a movement that fosters a virulent misogyny.Good Guys, Bad Guys exposes how even self-proclaimed feminist men inadvertently perpetuate gender inequality through their attitudes, behaviors, and relationships. As society navigates the complexities of gender activism, this book serves as a valuable resource in guiding the path towards a truly equal and inclusive future.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

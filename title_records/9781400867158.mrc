Cartan's proof of the existence of the projective imbedding of the compact "ient of such a domain by a discrete group. Part II treats the construction and properties of automorphic forms with respect to an arithmetic group acting on a bounded symmetric domain; this part is highly technical, and based largely on relevant results in functional analysis due to Godement and Harish-Chandra. In Part III, Professor Baily extends the discussion to include some special topics, specifically, the arithmetic propertics of Eisenstein series and their connection with the arithmetic theory of quadratic forms.Unlike classical works on the subject, this book deals with more than one variable, and it differs notably in its treatment of analysis on the group of automorphisms of the domain. It is concerned with the case of complex analytic automorphic forms because of their connection with algebraic geometry, and so is distinct from other modern treatises that deal with automorphic forms on a semi-simple Lie group.Having had its inception as graduate- level lectures, the book assumes some knowledge of complex function theory and algebra, for the serious reader is expected to supply certain details for himself, especially in such related areas as functional analysis and algebraic groups.Originally published in 1973.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

The current crisis in Scottish football includes high profile controversies and disorder related to bigotry and sectarianism which resulted in new legislation to tackle offensive behaviour in and beyond football grounds.In this collection, contributors from a range of disciplinary positions present the latest empirical research evidence and social theory to examine and debate fundamental issues about bigotry in Scottish football and society. The topic has raised many questions. How should sectarianism and bigotry be defined and understood? What are the experiences and impacts of bigotry on different populations in Scotland? Are recent events unique or do they have historic precedents and contemporary comparisons beyond Scotland? What should be the response of government, football authorities, clubs, football supporters and other institutions and organisations in Scotland regarding legislation? What vision should we have for a future Scottish society and its diverse population?Bigotry, Football and Scotland will appeal to all those interested in Scotland’s national game, the role of football in the 21st Century and how multicultural contemporary societies attempt to resolve prejudice and promote diversity.Key FeaturesMost recent academic work to address recent issues and debates about bigotry, football and sectarianism in ScotlandCovers gender, new legislation, internet conduct, social class and football supporters Case studies of fans and teams Inter-disciplinary mix of criminology, cultural studies, ethnic and racial studies, philosophy, gender studies, history, legal studies, sports studies and urban studiesA preface by Lord McConnell, former First Minister of ScotlandGBS_insertPreviewButtonPopup(['ISBN:9780748670376','ISBN:9780748670369','ISBN:9780748670383','ISBN:9780748670390']);"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

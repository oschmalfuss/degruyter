In response to concerns voiced by adolescents with CF, this revised edition tackles issues such as sexuality and personal relationships unique to people with CF. Also included is a section dealing with the transition to adult CF clinic care. This book is designed primarily for teens. However, families, clinicians and others whose lives are touched by CF will benefit from this combination of medical information and personal guidance. This new edition explains recent developments in the understanding and treatment of CF such as the discovery of the CF gene, CF carrier testing, and new respiratory and digestive therapies. Comprehensive and accessible, the volume also includes an expanded glossary of medical terms.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

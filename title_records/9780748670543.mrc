It examines previously overlooked photo narratives, poetry, prose and archival material and demonstrates an enduring dialogue between the poet’s relational aesthetics and documentary’s similarly interdisciplinary and creative approach to the world. By considering the sources of documentary in Rukeyser’s work, the study provides insight into her guiding poetic principles, situating her as a vital figure in the history of twentieth-century American literature and culture, and as a pioneering personality in the development of American Studies.Key Features Provides a new, interdisciplinary perspective on a critically neglected author, situating her firmly within the canon of essential 20th century American poetsExamines previously overlooked material, including photo narratives, poetry, prose, and archival materialHighlights Rukeyser’s role in the formation of American StudiesOutlines the development of documentary in the 1930s, and its role in the formation of an American literary and cultural aesthetic"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

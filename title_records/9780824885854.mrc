Within each reading are variations, and the student must learn which reading to use, and when to use it (or its variations), by referring to the context.This manual is aimed primarily at helping students determine correct usage (and therefore correct “pronunciation”) of the 500 most-used Chinese characters in Japanese. The characters are arranged in order of frequency of occurrence; this order is derived from a recent occurrence-frequency analysis of popular Japanese journals, conducted by the National Language Research Institute in Japan. A student who has mastered all of the 500 characters presented will be able to read and understand a large part of contemporary Japanese reading materials with relative ease.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

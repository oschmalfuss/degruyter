By drawing on analyses in political philosophy, political science, sociology, history, social theory and media studies, the essays in this collection discover new and forgotten ways of thinking about debt and North-South relations. They combine a discussion of the European and global North-South divide with an effort to retrieve alternatives to the dominant divisive uses of debt in staking out claims against someone else and as a means of social control."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

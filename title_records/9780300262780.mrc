Contemporaries added to this edition include Beyoncé, Sandra Cisneros, James Comey, Drake, Louise Glück, LeBron James, Brett Kavanaugh, Lady Gaga, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Barack Obama, John Oliver, Nancy Pelosi, Vladimir Putin, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and David Foster Wallace. The volume also reflects path-breaking recent research resulting in the updating of "ations from the first edition with more accurate wording or attribution. It has also incorporated noncontemporary "ations that have become relevant to the present day. In addition, The New Yale Book of Quotations reveals the striking fact that women originated many familiar "ations, yet their roles have been forgotten and their verbal inventions have often been credited to prominent men instead. This book’s "ations, annotations, extensive cross-references, and large keyword index will satisfy both the reader who seeks specific information and the curious browser who appreciates an amble through entertaining pages.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

His research topic was the River Thames as a commercial highway in the eighteenth century. This marked the first time that anyone in direct succession to the throne had ever studied outside Japan. In 1992, he published a record of his time at Oxford under the title Thames no tomo ni . The memoir, which includes a colour plate section incorporating photographs taken by the Prince, explores his daily life, studies and recreational experiences, including discovering beer and being banned from entering a disco because he was wearing jeans. The Thames and I is a remarkable record, not least because of its candour, but equally because it reveals the Crown Prince as an individual, including his personal charm and sense of humour. It will be of special interest to those wishing to know more about the future emperor of Japan.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

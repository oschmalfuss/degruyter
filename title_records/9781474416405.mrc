Murdoch believed that paying attention to art is a way for us to become less self-centred, and this book argues that cinema is the perfect form of art to enable us to do this. Bringing together Murdoch’s moral philosophy and contemporary cinema to build a dialogue about vision, ethics and love, author Lucy Bolton encourages us to view cinema as a way of studying other worlds and moral journeys, and to reflect upon their ethical significance in the world of the film and in our daily lives. Key featuresSets out the philosophical concerns of Iris Murdoch Stages an encounter between Murdoch’s moral philosophy and a range of international contemporary filmsFurthers the discipline of film-philosophy by bringing Murdoch’s thinking into relation with cinema in a sustained and detailed analysis  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

This book, however, which examines the development of the economy of Malta and its place in the wider Mediterranean economy in the period, paints a much more complex picture. It shows how Malta was the hub of alarge, complicated trading network, with Christians of various denominations, as well as Jews and Muslims, participating in commercial activity, and with well-developed instruments of trade and commercial law in place to supportthis network. It demonstrates that trade was not just in grain, a necessary commodity for Malta as a barren island with insufficient agriculture, but in a much wider range of goods, including even the sale and ransom of slaves. The book pays particular attention to the important commercial role of women, to safe conducts, which enabled Christians to trade in Muslim lands and vice versa, and to credit arrangements, which facilitated payments, even across the Christian-Muslim divide. Overall, rather than a key strong-point in a closed frontier, Malta is shown to have been a major centre of international exchange.

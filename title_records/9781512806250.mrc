These trends are considered with respect to the long-term developments of history, as well as with regard to their short-term interaction in the particular situation of Colonial Pennsylvania. The pattern of the interaction of these trends is delineated in detail with a view to examining the practical evolution of American Democracy and the roots of a distinct American civilization.It is noteworthy that The Layman's Progress attempts to introduce a new point of view into American Colonial historiography by focusing on contemporary attitudes rather than interpreting the period from the viewpoint of subsequent events. To this end the author has utilized a great deal of unpublished source material, some of which now appears for the first time in the Appendix. In addition, an effort has been made to emphasize those aspects of colonial history that have heretofore been largely neglected. Thus, the author gives special consideration to the interaction of the various ethnic and religious groups; more attention is devoted to religious affairs than to political, and the German groups are examined in closer detail than are the English groups.Thoroughly documented, clearly and imaginatively written, The Layman's Progress is a significant contribution to American Colonial historiography.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

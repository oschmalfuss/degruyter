Hyatt H. Waggoner reopens the debate, arguing that past criticism of Emerson has been limited by the inevitable but unfortunate influences of cultural relativism and personal taste. He suggests that by concentrating on the stabilities, on the recognizably similar patterns of response by critics to Emerson as poet, one can arrive at a portrait that transcends changing cultures and preferences. His book thus combines a full critical re-evaluation of Emerson's poetry with a thoughtful commentary on the ways in which critics and readers approach poetry.Originally published in 1975.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

They also reflect the crucial divergences in Badiou scholarship in a productive and enlightening way.Alain Badiou’s philosophical project is a genuine system in the traditional sense. It profoundly shakes up the field of thought as well as offering fresh insights into contemporary events. His concepts are becoming indispensable tools in a variety of fields, from philosophy to anthropology, including art, politics and theatre.Find out moreRead for free: we've published three entries on the Edinburgh University Press blogCinemaDeleuzePoliticsNotes on contributorsSee the full list of contributorsFull List of EntriesAbsolute (The)AffirmationismAntiphilosophyAppearance, existence–The appearing of truthAXIOMSamuel BeckettBeingThe Body–Body and identification–Body and Subject –Body and Event–Body and Void–Body and Organs–Body and the presentGeorg Cantor Category TheoryThe Twentieth Century–The passion of the real–Destruction vs Subtraction Consistent and Inconsistent MultiplicityCinemaCommunismCompossibilityDecisionGilles DeleuzeDemocracy–Democracy as a figure of state–Democracy as a philosophical notion–Democratic materialismDerridaDialecticsDisasterEncyclopaediaEthics and evilEventExistence/Non-ExistenceFactory/WorkerFEMINISMFidelityForcing –Forcing in ‘Infinitesimal Subversion–Forcing in Being and EventGenericMartin Heidegger History–Overturning the diametrical opposition between history and eternityIdeology–Ideology: Before 1968 –Ideology: After 1968InaestheticsInfinityUses of the word ‘Jew’Justice Immanuel KantKierkegaardLinguistic TurnLove Maoist politicsMarxist politics–The Four Fundamental Concepts of Marxism in TS–The ‘post-Maoism’ of post-BEMathemeMetaphysicsMetapolitics–Immanent conditions of politicsModelMultiplicity–At the origins of the concept of pure multiplicity–Pure multiplicityNatureNietzscheNouveaux philosophesNumbersSurreal NumbersObjectTHE ONEOntology, metaontologyPascalPhilosophical situationPlatonism/anti-PlatonismPoliticsPsychoanalysis + Sigmund FreudPsychoanalysis + LacanRANCIERE and EQUALITY–A common polemics–Equality and thought–The axiomatic or procedural status of equality –Subject and sequenceRepresentationRomanticismSans-PapiersJean-Paul SartreSaint Paul–Paul and the Subjective Consequences of the Event–Paul and ‘the present’–The antinomies of militancy–ResurrectionSaturationSchoenberg–How are we to understand such a philosophical relation?SexualitySiteSophistryBaruch SpinozaFigures of the Subject*–Subject as sequence–The Faithful Subject–The Reactive Subject–The Obscure Subject– ResurrectionSubtraction – undecidable, indiscernible, generic, unnameable –The undecidable–The indiscernible –The generic–The unnameable –Subtraction: affirmation and negation Suture–Ideological Suture–Ontological Suture–Philosophical Suture System TheatreThermidorianTruthTopology Transcendental Regime The TwoUniversalityVOIDWagnerWoman, the feminine, sexual difference–SUBTRACTION: woman as particularity–SUBLIMATION: woman as a guarantee of universality for humanity–SUBLATION: woman as the going-beyond of the OneLudwig WittgensteinWorlds–Worldliness and CapitalismErrataFigures of the SubjectOn p. 324, the word ‘operative’ should read ‘inoperative’ (rendering exactly the opposite meaning as that currently given).PascalOn p. 244, lines 23–5 contain a misplaced reference in parentheses that belongs to, and is included in full in, the entry on Kierkegaard and should simply be ignored here."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

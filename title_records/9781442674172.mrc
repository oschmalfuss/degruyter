This supplement corrects the original book and adds considerably to its contents. As well as verifying as many of Tremaine's original library locations as possible and identifying additional copies of the items, the authors have included many new entries of items that have come to light in the last forty-five years. The new work is an analytical bibliography of previously unrecorded eighteenth-century Canadian imprints and a source for the study of early print culture in the Maritimes, Quebec, and Ontario. The definition of imprint has been extended to encompass all products of the press, from books and official documents to job printing such as handbills, commercial notices, licences, and land grants. The work includes a transcription of the accounts of more than thirty years of book and job printing from the Brown/Neilson office in Quebec City, the most extensive collection of business records left by an early Canadian print shop.In addition to the supplement, we are also reissuing the original edition of Tremaine. A detailed index to the supplement provides multiple points of access to the contents of both bibliographies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

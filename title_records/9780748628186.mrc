She asks how Jane Eyre can still evoke tears and rage, as well as inspiring imitation and high art, and why Henry James has become fiction’s favourite late Victorian character in the new millennium? ‘Victoriana’, the book argues, has developed a modern history of its own in which we can trace the shifting social and cultural concerns of the last few decades. Through the constant interrogation of ‘history’ in such innovative works as John Fowles’s The French Lieutenant’s Woman, A.S. Byatt’s Possession, David Lodge’s Nice Work, Peter Ackroyd’s Dickens, Jane Campion’s The Piano, Colm Tóibín’s The Master, Sarah Waters’s Fingersmith, Alan Hollinghurst’s The Line of Beauty and Julian Barnes’s Arthur and George, 'Victoriana' maps out a very particular postmodern temporality.Features*Uses the Victorian as a touchstone for late 20th and early 21st century writers helping readers to understand the changing meaning of Victorian literature and culture across time.*Explores different genres of Victoriana showing the differences and convergences in the ways in which criticism, biography, fiction and film rewrite the Victorian.*Analyses the pleasures and politics of reading or viewing the recycling of the Victorian past highlighting the relationship between the act of reading and the social and political elements of the texts.*Focuses on work by well-known writers, critics, filmmakers and artists such as A S Byatt, David Lodge, ColmTóibín and Sarah Waters in relationship to nineteenth-century authors such as Charlotte Brontë, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Dickens and  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

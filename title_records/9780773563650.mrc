Rosanna Leprohon, May Agnes Fleming, Margaret Murray Robertson, Susan Frances Harrison, Margaret Marshall Saunders, and Joanna E. Wood were once-popular novelists who are now for the most part ignored, with virtually all of their works out of print. MacMillan, McMullen, and Waterston show that these six writers deserve modern recognition not only for their literary accomplishments but also for what they reveal, through their work and their lives, about the condition of the woman writer in nineteenth-century Canada. The writings of these six women from varied backgrounds reflect their different experiences of life in the late nineteenth century. In this study a biographical profile of each author, set in the contemporary social context, is provided, as well as an analysis of career development, emphasising publishing history and critical response. As each case history unfolds, the broader picture emerges of an era when many ideas of personal and public life were changing.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

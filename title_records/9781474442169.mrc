As an independent producer and an increasingly reclusive personality he developed his own, excessive brand of melodrama, haunted by irresistible temptations, obsessive desires, mad jealousies and toxic moralism. All this has now been thoroughly explored by means of combining cultural and historical contextualisation with formalist analysis. ReFocus: The Films of Teuvo Tulio: An Excessive Outsider is the first English-language study on this innovative director. Three internationally recognized scholars analyse the strange trajectory of his career through its impressive beginning within the Finnish studio system to becoming an outsider, an independent producer-director who could single-mindedly pursue his own, highly idiosyncratic line.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

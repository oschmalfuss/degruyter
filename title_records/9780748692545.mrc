Their answer is simple enough – philosophy ‘is the art of forming, inventing and fabricating concepts’. In this book, Jeffrey Bell explores what that involves. Crucial to Deleuze and Guattari’s understanding of this task, Bell argues, is the assumption that philosophy is integral to a life well lived. Bell shows that a concept of learning is created through the course of the text, composed of three inseparable components: philosophy, science and art. Ultimately, What is Philosophy? can be understood as a meditation on a life well lived, with this concept of learning at its core.

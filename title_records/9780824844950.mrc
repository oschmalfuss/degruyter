From May to August it nests and raises its young on Alaska's chilly subarctic tundra. Come winter, just as its plumage turns from black and white to gold and brown, the kolea makes its way to Hawaii's distant shores, where it will remain for the next eight months before returning to Alaska. It undertakes this incredible journey of nearly 3,000 miles twice a year without stopping once to rest or feed. Amazingly, young kolea, left far behind on the Alaskan coast, find their way to Hawaii without any help from their parents. Those of us who witness the comings and goings of these amazing birds often wonder how they travel across thousands of miles of trackless ocean without losing their way. What signs or clues do they follow? Do they use the sun and stars as their guides? The ability of the kolea to navigate such a tremendous distance remains a mystery. In the first part of this book you will journey with the kolea from the treeless plains near the Arctic Circle, across the vast Pacific Ocean, to its warm and sunny winter home in Hawaii. The second part contains information on habitat, food, nesting and breeding, and the challenges facing scientists who study kolea migration. Both sections are clearly written and will engage and inform young readers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

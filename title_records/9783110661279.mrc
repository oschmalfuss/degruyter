It seeks to explore the ways in which the plays in question were reworked, discussed, represented or reperformed within varying frameworks. Notably enough, research on the reception of tragic fragments could yield insight not only into the receiving work, but also into the facets of the source text that have attracted attention in its subsequent refigurations. It could thus shed light on the ideological and cultural routes through which these fragmentary tragedies were received by the poet, the scholar, the artist, the viewer, the reader and the spectator in each case. The complex process of the refiguration of a fragmentarily preserved play within different contexts could form a yardstick of its cultural power and elucidate the dynamics of fragmentation in modern times. Τhe volume is of particular interest to scholars in the fields of classics, reception, cultural and performance studies, as well as to readers fascinated by Greek tragedy and its vibrant afterlife.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 21.

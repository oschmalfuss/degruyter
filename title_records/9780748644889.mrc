Driven by market forces it has grown rapidly in Muslim countries and in international financial sectors. It is projected to grow at an annual rate of 15-20% and a key factor determining this future growth is the availability of new products that will satisfy the needs of various segments of society.While other texts discuss the basic principles and contracts used in Islamic banking and finance, few discuss how these can be used to develop financial products. This book fills that gap, starting with the basic principles that form the building blocks of contemporary Islamic financial products and then discussing the more intricate issues relating to product development processes.Key FeaturesDiscusses the different stages of the product development cycle in detailIncludes case studies showing the structures of various productsCritically evaluates the issues related to product development including the types of products used by Islamic banks and the approaches adopted in developing themThe author is well-positioned to write this text, having been an economist at the Islamic Development Bank Group in Saudi Arabia (1999-2007)  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

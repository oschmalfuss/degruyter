Colourful and charismatic, he virtually "lit up" the province as a Minister in the Douglas government, not only by establishing the groundwork for rural electrification, but also by igniting a multitude of entrepreneurial experiments. A man ahead of his time, Phelps spoke on behalf of women's issues, the environment, and advocated for First Nations rights. But his unrelenting push for change alienated many and Phelps had only one term in government. He was not asked to run again. Fiery Joe celebrates the achievements of a remarkable man whose energy drive for innovation ultimately outstripped the system he wished to change. "Joe Phelp's contribution to building Saskatchewan and Canada in an important demonstration of what big dreams can achieve." - Roy J. Romanow, former Premier of Saskatchewan.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

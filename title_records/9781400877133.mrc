He has barbed words for those who expect easy solutions to international problems, as well as for those who succumb to despair or take refuge in isolationism. With penetrating insight he outlines the problems introduced by the new scale of armed force in atomic warfare, he considers the problems of international coalitions, and he analyzes the question of secret versus open diplomacy. Particularly important is his conception of the mediating role that the United Nations does play now, and the role that it can play in the future. Mr. Pearson approaches all these problems with vision but at the same time with the hard-headed realism of an active statesman, as shown especially in his final chapter on the influences which determine the international policies of the democracies.Originally published in 1955.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

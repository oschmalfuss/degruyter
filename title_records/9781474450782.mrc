To create a multiplicitous, open and elastic milieu that is conducive to processes of both individuation and singularisation. Hanjo Berressem covers the whole range of Guattari’s solo work, as well as the books co-authored with Gilles Deleuze. The core of his argument is developed through a rigorous explication and analysis of Guattari’s Schizoanalytic Cartographies. This reveals an ecological ontology developed from key concepts such as the informal diagram, the abstract machine and transversality, which is based on the conceptual complementarity of the world (the given) and its creatures (the giving).  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

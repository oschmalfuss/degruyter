Local councillors have had to adjust to the introduction of elected mayors, cabinet government and scrutiny committees, and cope with a range of other new initiatives. This book is a unique attempt to provide a coherent analysis of the impact of these changes on the world of local politics. The book provides a comprehensive review of the operation of politics in local government, including the impact of national and local political parties on the behaviour of party groups in local authorities, the way party groups interact with each other, the changing role of local political leadership and the relationship of local politicians with senior council officers. The changing role of local politics in Britain Is essential reading for undergraduate and postgraduate students and their teachers on local government, politics, public policy and public administration courses, as well as officers in local authorities who wish to gain a deeper understanding of the political environment in which they work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

It gives a historically contextualised close reading of works from authors who have been studied as pioneers of Arabic and Turkish literatures, such as Ziya Pasha, Jurjī Zaydān, Maʿrūf al-Ruṣāfī and Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar.The Ottoman Canon analyses how these authors prepared the arguments and concepts that shape how we study Arabic and Turkish literatures today as they reassessed the relationship among the Ottoman canon’s linguistic traditions. Furthermore, The Ottoman Canon examines the Ottoman reception of pre-Ottoman poets, such as Kaʿb ibn Zuhayr, hence opening up new research avenues for Arabic literature, Ottoman studies and comparative literature.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

Yet little is known about the learning process, and much less about what pedagogical strategies might facilitate or, otherwise, hinder it. This book thus aims to further understanding of the acquisition of Chinese as a foreign or second language. It brings together six independent studies which explore aspects of learning Chinese as an additional language across the domains of morphosyntax, pragmatics, cognitive capacity, interactional learning, and instructed learning via a variety of conceptual frameworks and methodological strategies. These studies, as well as the suggestions for future research, will be of great interest to second language acquisition researchers, graduate students and second language teachers of Chinese, as well as to curriculum developers and materials writers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

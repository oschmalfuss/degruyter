Unlike many who hold the conventional sociological view of disability as a 'lack' or stigmatized identity, Tanya Titchkosky approaches disability as an agentive (not passive) embodiment of liminality and as a demonstration of socially valuable in-between-ness. She argues that disability can and should be a 'teacher' to, and about, non-disabled or 'temporarily abled' society.Titchkosky's poignant reflections on disability rely on the thought of Hannah Arendt as well as her personal experience as an individual with dyslexia living with a blind partner; she uniquely draws on her own and others' situations in order to demonstrate the sociopolitical character of disability. A thoughtful and cohesive integration of narrative and theory, Disability, Self, and Society presents a critical Canadian contribution to the growing subject of disability studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

Bethan Thomas and Danny Dorling have brought together this outstanding atlas to provide us with a unique visual picture of identity and geography combined. Identity in Britain explores our changing identities as we progress from infancy to old age and tells the story of the myriad geographies of life in Britain.  Features and benefits include: over 280 full colour, detailed maps analysis of the contemporary neighbourhood geographies of people in Britain at various life stages clear introduction and how-to-use guide making the atlas highly accessible for a wide range of users locational reference maps to aid interpretation of the maps on each page Accompanying web resources, including locational cartograms Unlike conventional atlases of human geography, it allows us to see a range of data on a single map; further it allows us to easily see what social mixing does not occur as well as what does. Never before have we had such a vivid geographical picture of identity in Britain today. The atlas is essential reading for those interested in contemporary human identity and the social geography of early twenty first century Britain. It is also an invaluable resource for researchers working in a wide range of statutory and voluntary organisations, policy makers, journalists, politicians, students and academics.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

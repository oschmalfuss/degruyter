This book provides a comprehensive theoretical framework to help research this highly prolific and diverse production of contemporary literary texts. Based on the achievements of historical poetics, in particular those of Russian formalism and its theoretical legacy, this framework offers flexible, transparent, and unbiased tools to understand the relevant contexts within the literary system. The aim is to enhance our understanding of Arabic literature, throw light on areas of literary production that traditionally have been neglected, and stimulate others to take up the fascinating challenge of mapping out and exploring them.Key featuresIncludes inventories of both canonized and non-canonized literary texts in three sections: texts for adults, texts for children, and translated texts for adults and childrenLooks at the historical diachronic interaction of literature with various extra-literary systems such as religion, territory, state nationalism, language, politics, economy and gender as well as foreign literatures and culturesFocuses on the study of each genre together with examining the relationships between the various genres and the role of translation in their developmentHighlights the concept of periodization, looking at how to delimit and define literary periodsConceptualizes sociocultural distinctions of text production in terms of literary stratification, avoiding evaluative judgments  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Everything he wrote, from his earliest compositions right up to his finalworks, is analysed here; the history and background of each work and its critical reception are all examined, set against events in Delius's life and the wider musical world. The book contains numerous music examples and "ations from many contemporary newspapers and journals. A complete list of all of Delius's works, with catalogue numbers, and a select bibliography are also provided. MARTIN LEE-BROWNE is the Chairman of The Delius Society, a former Chairman of the Gloucester Three Choirs Festival, and author of The Life & Times of Frederic Austin (1996). PAUL GUINERY is a pianist and associate of the Royal College of Music, as well as a former broadcaster for BBC Radio 3 and co-author (with Lyndon Jenkins) of Delius and Fenby, A Photographic Journey (The Delius Society, 2004).  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

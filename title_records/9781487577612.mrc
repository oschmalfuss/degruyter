In this detailed study, Dr May analyses Kant’s concept of geography, placing it in the context of his philosophy. In addition, he analyses several currently held positions respecting the nature of geography and compares these positions with that of Kant in order to gain further insight into his concept of geography and to determine how valid it is as a foundation for contemporary geography. The book also contains a discussion of the origins, development, and influence of Kant’s concept of geography, and an historical sketch of the relations between philosophy and geography through the history of Western thought. This is a book for geographers with an interest in the history and philosophy of their discipline, Kant scholars, and anyone interested in the philosophy of science.

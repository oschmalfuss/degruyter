The book is based on the experiences of the Building Health Promotion Capacity Project (1998-2003), a continuing education and applied research venture affiliated with the Saskatchewan Heart Health Program. The project studied the process of capacity development in relation to practitioners and regional health districts in Saskatchewan. For health promotion practitioners across Canada and beyond, this book provides a coherent framework for effective professional practice. Leaders in health sector organizations will develop a firmer grasp of how to support health promotion practice and how to recruit and retain individual practitioners with a high level of capacity. Policy makers will improve their knowledge of environments that support the health promotion capacity of individuals and organizations. Scholars will learn about the nature of health promotion capacity and about a methodology for its study.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

This book offers a new interpretation of Ozu’s career, from his earliest work in the 1920s up to his death in 1963, focusing on Ozu’s depiction of the everyday life and experiences of ordinary Japanese people during a time of depression, war and economic resurgence. Firmly situating him within the context of the Japanese film industry, Woojeong Joo examines Ozu’s work as a studio director and his relation to sound cinema, and looks in-depth at his wartime experiences and his adaptation to post-war Japanese society. Drawing on Japanese materials not previously examined in western scholarship, this is a ground-breaking new study of a master of cinema.Case studies include:Ozu’s shōshimin films Ozu’s wartime films, including the script of The Flavour of Green Tea over RicePostwar script of The Moon Has RisenTokyo Story"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

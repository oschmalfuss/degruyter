International staffing decisions are supported by the International Human Resource Controlling and an International Human Resource Information System with the help of web-based tools. These information instruments are necessary for the recruitment of international managerial staff and their delegation in the context of personnel development programs worldwide. In order to avoid mistakes when delegating employees, it is recommendable to point out the social security law, especially pension and health insurance issues to them at an early stage. It will become a standard in International Management to train employees and managerial staff on legal issues on the range of topics of Diversity Management and to sensitize them for European Labour Law and International Law. The delegated person can obtain information on their country of delegation via country profiles and at the same time learn the necessary language skills.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

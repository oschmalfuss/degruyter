It also addresses those concerned with Romanticism in general, with feminist criticism, and with the cultural history of women. Who were las románticas? The first generation of Spanish women to conceive of themselves as ";writing women,"; they made their appearance in the press around 1841. It was the apogee of Spain's Romantic movement and of a first wave of liberal reforms, and these women gave voice to their experience as women within the terms of liberal Romantic ideology. Susan Kirkpatrick examines the textual representations that link liberal ideology, Romantic configurations of subjectivity, and women's writing, in an exciting revelation of early nineteenth-century gender consciousness.

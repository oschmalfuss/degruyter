The authors examine the psychosocial needs of women living with breast cancer, while investigating differences in treatment, care, and survivorship amongst Aboriginal women, women of colour, francophone women, lesbians, as well as young women, lower-income women, and women in rural areas. Structured as a guide for similar research, Cancer on the Margins provides a "start to finish" format that reveals the complexities of doing such work at each stage of research, beginning with the study design and ending with the dissemination of results. The authors address the challenges of working with and speaking for these groups of women, the tension between description and interpretation, and the challenge for qualitative work to present findings that positively influence the circumstances of research participants. With a strong commitment to social justice, this volume also shows how participatory research can lead to social change, and indicates effective ways to ensure that research not only reaches, but is also employed in, the communities it intends to serve. Bridging the gap between a wide range of audiences, this vitally important work will be of interest to health professionals, new researchers, policy makers, new researchers, and experienced investigators, as well as the public.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

The book discusses the complex interactions that take place on these commercial artefacts, the ways they communicate to both ‘highbrow’ and ‘lowbrow’ audiences, and the manner in which they breach tradition taste distinctions. Including case studies of features like Cannibal Holocaust, Funny Games and Antichrist, the book explores the complicated dichotomies between art and exploitation films to present a fluid history of extreme art cinema.Key featuresArgues for the critical and cultural significance of paratexts, and the DVD in particular, in shaping our interaction with extreme art cinemaProvides primary analysis to help examine existing debates surrounding extreme art cinema and its employment of exploitation traditionsIntroduces a novel area of paratextual investigation which moves away from the more traditional exploration of epiphenomena associated with large fan propertiesHighlights the way paratextual materials define the identity of a text through their application of certain signifiersComplicates the dichotomies between art and exploitation cinema to present a fluid history of extreme art cinemaInserts exploitation cinema more definitively into discourses of extreme art film  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

This book looks at the rich history of ‘Scandinavian noir’, examines the appeal of this particular genre and attempts to reveal why it is distinct from the plethora of other crime fictions.Examining the popularity of Steig Larsson’s international success with his Millennium trilogy, as well as Henning Mankell’s Wallander across the various media, Peacock also tracks some lesser-known novels and television programmes. He illustrates how the bleakness of the country’s ‘noirs’ reflects particular events and cultural and political changes, with the clash of national characteristics becoming a key feature.It will appeal to students and researchers of crime fiction and of film and television studies, as well as the many fans of the novels and dramatic representations.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

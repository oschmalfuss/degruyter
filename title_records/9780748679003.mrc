In doing so, he reforms our historical perceptions of what has often been dismissed as a ‘dark age’.Key Features:An updated edition in a classic seriesTakes a new approach to ‘dark age’ historyDraws together new historiography on contentious theoriesUtilises artefacts and archaeology to enlighten the period  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

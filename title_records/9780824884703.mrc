In addition, major research facilities, capital equipment, and provisions for publications are indicated as well as descriptions of accommodations available, instructional program, teaching facilities and scientific staff.Biographical sketches of 1,300 personnel give institutional affiliation, mailing address, field of specialization, current research project, and field experience by geographical region.A cross-reference index lists each laboratory under its official name, the sponsoring agency, and the area in which it is located. Data for all laboratories are broken down into a treatment of inland laboratories (fresh-water) and coastal laboratories (marine), and finally segregated by geographical area.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

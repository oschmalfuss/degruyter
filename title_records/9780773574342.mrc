While the ultimate meaning of the Sixties remains elusive, there is no doubt that they had an immense effect on Canadians - culturally, politically, and economically. The Sixties takes a multidisciplinary approach that includes history, architecture, art, political science, and journalism. Contributors examine a range of eclectic issues - from the intersection of Joyce Wieland's artwork with Pierre Trudeau's nationalism, to the debate over the changing skylines of Toronto and Montreal, to de Gaulle's famous 1967 "Vive le Québec libre!" speech - to provide a distinctly Canadian perspective on one of the liveliest and most debated periods in modern history. Four decades after Canada's own Expo 67 "summer of love," this timely book conjures up the images, sounds, and tastes of a decade that remains an indelible part of our twenty-first century experience. Contributors include Gretta Chambers (McGill), Christopher Dummitt (Trent), Olivier Courteaux (Ryerson), Frances Early (Mount Saint Vincent), Kristy Holmes (Queen's), Marcel Martel (York), Nicholas Olsberg (Canadian Centre for Architecture), Francine Vanlaethem (UQAM), and Krys Verrall (York)."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

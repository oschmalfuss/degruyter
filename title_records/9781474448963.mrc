The author demonstrates how the once-heterogeneous identities of Middle Eastern peoples were sealed into a standardised and uniform version that persists to this day. He also sheds light on the efforts that peoples in the region – in the context of a new process of homogenisation of diversities – are exerting in order to get back into history, regaining possession of their multifaceted pasts.Key featuresLargely based on primary sources (in English, Arabic, Hebrew, Ottoman Turkish, German, Italian and French) from 19 archives in the Middle East, Europe and the USProvides an intra-regional historical understanding of the (past and ongoing) politicisation of ethno-religious differences in the Middle East  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

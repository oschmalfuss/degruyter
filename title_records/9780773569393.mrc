At the onset of the twenty-first century, he was instrumental in determining the Serb's fate, and also that of former Yugoslavia and the Balkans. And no woman throughout Serbian history (and few elsewhere) has been as influential as Milosevic's wife, Professor Mira Markovic. This book is about them, their regime, and the circumstances in which the Serbs encountered their greatest setbacks and became global pariahs. Although there have been many attempts to tell Slobodan Milosevic's story, Milosevic and Markovic is the first book to shows us the real person. Originally written in Serbo-Croatian by a Yugoslav journalist and driven underground in its native country, Milosevic and Markovic offers a first-hand account of Milosevic's life, including the recent events in Kosovo. Slavoljub Djukic sheds light on Milosevic's autocratic rule, showing how he, with his wife, Mira Markovic, has dominated Serbia's political life for the last twelve years - first as president of Serbia and later as president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Engrossing and beautifully written, Milosevic and Markovic is both a biography and an engaging political commentary on events in Yugoslavia and Serbia over the last two decades. Avoiding the speculation and intrigue that surrounds Milosevic, Djukic provides a clear, factual commentary that shows that the results of the Milosevic/Markovic regime will be felt by the people of Yugoslavia for years to come.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

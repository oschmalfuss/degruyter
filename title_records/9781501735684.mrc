Ms. Baym brings the crucial facts of Hawthorne’s career into clear focus, and places the individual works within the total picture. Disputing some enduring critical pieties, she finds in Hawthorne a writer who experimented with a series of literary poses through which he tried both to discover himself and to please his audience. He realized late, she says, the paradox that the more he departed from conventional modes, the more "popular" his writing became. By looking discerningly at all of Hawthorne’s work as it unfolded, Ms. Baym produces compelling new insights into a major American writer and adds appreciably to our understanding of him.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

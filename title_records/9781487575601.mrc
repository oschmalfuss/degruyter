The ICMSF was formed in 1962 in reponse to the need for internationally acceptable and authoritative decisions on microbiological limits for foods commensurate with public health safety, and particularly for foods in international commerce. The membership of ICMSF consists of food-microbiologists whose combined professional itnerests include research, public health, official food control, education, and industrial research and development. They are all well-known scientists drawn from government laboratories in health, agriculture and food technology, from universities, and from the food industry. The influence of the Committee is being augmented by the formation of regional subcommittees throughout the world. This book is divided into three parts: the first deals with the significance of microorganisms in foods -- pathogens, food-poisoning organisms and their toxins, indicator species and spoilage groups; part two is a compendium of the methods of microbiological analysis and enumeration, the last part lists the composition of 104 media and of the diagnostic reagents to be used in association with the various procedures. Prerequisite to a major objective of the Committee, namely, microbiological standards, are internationally acceptable methods for enumeration of the many pertinent classes of microorganisms in foods. This book describes the methods shown to have been used most effectively in many countries. It fills an urgent need and dispels much controversy and indecision which hitherto have prevailed in regard both to the significance of microorganisms and to acceptable methodology. It will prove invaluable to all concerned with the microbiological content of foods, whether in government control agencies, industry, teaching or research institutions.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Despite this, enrollments in German programs have increased modestly. The importance of Germany and its language on the world stage is undeniable: it has demonstrated its strength as a major world economic power, and Germany continues to invest heavily throughout the world. Inspired by the leadership of Helene Zimmer-Loew, longtime Executive Director of the American Association of Teachers of German, the contributors to this volume examine the factors shaping German-language study in the new millennium. They highlight how innovative curricular design, creative applied research, inspirational leadership, inventive professional development, and entrepreneurial approaches have allowed German to weather many of its challenges. This volume will be of interest to scholars, teachers, and students of German who are committed to invigorating its study in the United States. Contributors: Teresa R.

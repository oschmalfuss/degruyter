North American Beavers, along with humans, are the only mammals whose impact on their environment is so massive that it can be clearly seen with the naked eye from outer space. And there really are Narwhals - the single-tusked mammals that likely inspired the unicorn legend - living in the waters surrounding Greenland.Learning about any of these mammals on their own brings out fascinating traits and stories. But when considered alongside the entire mammal population of Canada - from the tiny Olive-Backed Pocket Mouse to the enormous Killer Whale, and the Arctic-dwelling Polar Bear to the more southerly Red Bat - a spectacular portrait emerges of the diversity and beauty of Canada's animal life.The Natural History of Canadian Mammals is a beautifully illustrated, up-to-date guide to all 215 known species of mammals in Canada. It features brand-new, full-colour images of each species, as well as stunning photographs from Canadian Geographic magazine's national photography competitions depicting the animals in their natural environments. Along with being a visual treat, this book is jam-packed with information accessible to readers at all levels. Detailed descriptions are provided of each mammal's appearance, habitat, and behavior, while colour maps show their full distribution across Canada, North America, and globally. The book also includes practical guides on tracking and identification for readers who would like to learn how to spot mammals in the wild. Among its most special features is a series of colour plates with vignettes of the Canadian representatives of each group, sized relative to one another for easy comparison and linked to the full species accounts later in the book.Comprehensive and immensely valuable, The Natural History of Canadian Mammals will become a treasured companion for scientific researchers, animal lovers, and all those wishing to gain a greater appreciation of Canada's natural wonders. The Canadian Museum of Nature, Canada's national natural history museum, continues to author these wonderful books in its goal to inspire a greater understanding of the natural environment.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 08.

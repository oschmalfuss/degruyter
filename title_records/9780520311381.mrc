Many of the essays in this book--the majority are published her for the first time--disclose hitherto unsuspected aspects of the poet's beliefs, while others are studies in depth of areas of his work which, although frequently discussed, have never before been properly examined. Seldom, in fact, have so many pioneering studies been assembled between the covers of a single volume. The various contributors are eminently qualified to treat the specific ideas and interests of Pound's about which they write, and the book as a co-ordinated whole comprehensively covers his--and our artistic culture. Eminent scholars and critics from five different countries have come together in this attempt to 'unscrew the inscrutable': Richard EllemannLeslie FiedlerForrest ReadN. Christoph de NagyWalter BaumannGuy DavenportJ. P. SullivanJohn EspeyDonal DavieGeorge DekkerBoris de RachewiltzAlbert CookHugh KennerChristine Broke-Rose Eva Hesse--well-known here and in Germany as a critic and translator--establishes the interrelationships between the various fields of study and examines some of Pound's key concepts from the aspect of the history of ideas. New Approaches to Ezra Pound should serve as a valuable source book for all students of literature and may above all be expected to act as a catalyst for future studies.

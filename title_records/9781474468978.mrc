The book begins with the devastating impact of World War I and Scotland’s critical role in its conduct, then continues to explore Scots institutional life, from 1922 to 1964, governed by the problems of economy, society, politics and culture embedded in a mature industrialised state with economic problems and governmental deficits. Two further chapters cover the period from 1964 to 1999, including the challenge of new industries, oil discoveries, and the rise of devolutionary and nationalist politics. A new section for this edition covers the course of devolved politics, from the Scottish parliament of 1999 to the financial collapse of 2008 and the constitutional upheavals of 2014-15, rounding off this unique interpretation of a century of Scottish life from a cherished and multi-faceted historian.Praise for previous editions:‘Harvie has achieved a masterly synthesis of the most important political, economic, social and cultural developments in Scotland’s recent past, written too with great wit and style … fully deserves the gratitude of students and scholars for making Scottish history so accessible and stimulating.’ -- English Historical Review‘Indispensable to anyone seeking to understand modern Scotland.’ -- Glasgow Herald‘… a bold and original book shot through with novel ideas.’ -- Scottish Historical Review  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

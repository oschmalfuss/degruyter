Place and Practice in Canadian Nursing History looks at nurses and nursing in a wide range of settings from the mid-1800s to the 1970s, including indigenous women on the Canadian prairies; First World War nurses posted overseas; outpost nurses in rural and remote areas of Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec; public health nurses in Winnipeg; and religious congregations in nursing education in New Brunswick. The contributors use feminist and historical perspectives to illustrate how place – understood as both social context and geographic setting – shaped nursing identities and practices. They point out that many nurses found place both liberating and constraining, often simultaneously. Paying attention to place also situates these nurses and their work within larger historical themes of nation-building, war, and political change. Highlighting the complex relationship between place and practice, this volume offers fresh interpretations of nursing history and the history of Canadian health care in general. It will interest historians of gender, race, class, work, and health care, nurse educators and their students, as well as professional nurses and other members of the public interested in nursing history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

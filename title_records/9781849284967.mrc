Most businesses are now aware of the importance of information security. However, some organisations struggle to understand what an information security breach would mean from a business management point of view. This can lead to organisations investing in expensive solutions which may not necessarily address their requirements. This pocket guide uses case studies to illustrate the possible breach scenarios that an organisation can face. It sets out a sensible, realistic assessment of the actual costs of a data or information breach and explains how managers can determine the business damage caused. This balanced view helps managers and business decision makers to form better assessments of their organisation's information security needs. It also gives readers the knowledge to fend off any security vendors who might try to make sales by spreading panic and exaggerating the consequences of a breach. With this book's help, you can make sure your information security system is right for your business.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

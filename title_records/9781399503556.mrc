His ground-breaking work has spanned many disciplines, his approach to ‘global microhistory’ has focused on questions of space and circulation (people, texts and objects). In addition, he has made important contributions to the social and cultural history of Early Modern Catholicism.In order to allow the international public to access his work, this volume presents a collection of Heyberger’s studies for the first time in English, accompanied by an essay discussing the importance and legacy of his work and a comprehensive bibliography of his writings.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

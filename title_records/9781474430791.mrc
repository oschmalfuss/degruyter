He shows how Nietzsche’s narratives engage with philosophical issues about agency, self-knowledge, historical explanation and the critique of morality.On the Genealogy of Morality has become the most common point of entry into Nietzsche’s thought. It offers relatively straightforward, sustained explanatory narratives addressing many of the main ideas of Nietzsche’s mature thought, such as will to power, nihilism, perspectivism, the value of truth and the critique of morality. At the same time, it is challenging to understand because Nietzsche intended it as an expansion and elaboration of his existing ideas.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

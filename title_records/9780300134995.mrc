Foley contends that the United States has become a nation of too many laws where citizens retain precious few pockets of individual liberty.With a close analysis of urgent constitutional questions-abortion, physician-assisted suicide, medical marijuana, gay marriage, cloning, and U.S. drug policy-Foley shows how current constitutional interpretation has gone astray. Without the bias of any particular political agenda, she argues convincingly that we need to return to original conceptions of the Constitution and restore personal freedoms that have gradually diminished over time.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Framing Wilde's literary writing in relation to his very active participation in the radical political culture of the fin de siècle, Ó Donghaile argues that, contrary to contemporary representations of Wilde as an effete and socially disengaged figure, his aesthetical radicalism was informed by and contributed to a broader set of progressive political initiatives being pursued at the end of the nineteenth century. Consisting of previously unpublished material, the book provides a politicised and historicised account of Wilde’s key works by situating them within the framework of his very pronounced ideological commitment to these radical political causes.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

The Siddoos are Punjabi. Kapoor Singh, father and grandfather, arrived in British Columbia in 1912 and had to overcome racial prejudice and legal discrimination to transform himself from labourer to lumber baron. As he campaigned for citizenship and immigration rights for his people, he and his wife, Besant Kaur, fostered in their daughters a vision of service and activism that, as adults, they fulfilled by establishing a family-run hospital in Punjab and by introducing a Westernized version of an Indian spiritual tradition to Canada. The Siddoos are the heart of the story, but their history tells a larger tale of an immigrant community's triumphs and tribulations and the strong connection that Indo-Canadians continue to forge with their homeland.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

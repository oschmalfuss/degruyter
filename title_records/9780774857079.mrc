Receiving particular attention is the socio-economic and residential structure of Vancouver with one author arguing that the city's economy created an urban working class which was at once more complex and politically more conservative than that of the highly polarized communities on Vancouver Island and in the Interior. An article exploring the pre-1916 activities of the Sam Kee Company, one of the wealthiest merchant firms in Chinatown, offers a fascinating look inside the immigrant world and attests to the importance of business in facilitating immigrant settlement in the New World. Almost forgotten now are the accomplishments of the Mothers' Council of Vancouver -- a group of politically active women who gave support to the unemployed and the strikers from 1935-1938. Another writer recalls the 1946 occupation of the old Hotel Vancouver when a group of veterans protested against the city's acute housing shortage. Other essays deal with elementary schooling from the 1920's to the 1960's, labour history, the geographic and social development of neighbourhoods, crime during the Great Depression, and childbirth and hospitalization. The volume provides a lively portrait of city life over a sixty-year period and lays the groudwork for future analysis of the modern metropolis as we know it today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

But how did the growing development of the feminist movement in this period impact on Italian film culture? And what role did that film culture play in women’s lives?This book explores the multiple intersections between feminism and Italian cinema from the perspective of women’s everyday relationship with the medium. Drawing from a feminist approach to Gramscian cultural theory, the book builds an archival counter-history of Italian cinema in which women took part as movie-goers, activists and practitioners, by means of a collective-historical agency that challenged cinema’s patriarchal structures and strategies of invisibilisation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

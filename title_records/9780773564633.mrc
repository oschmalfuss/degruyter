Loosely linked by the theme of power and discussion of carnivalesque elements of traditional and popular culture, these studies examine immigrants' narratives about adjusting to life in Canada; Morris dancing as practised by Forest City Morris of London, Ontario; and actions and responses of promoters and residents to the development of the Shakespeare festival in Stratford, Ontario. Greenhill notes that because the English are perceived as lacking carnivalesque traditions, their position vis-à-vis other ethnic groups has been defined solely in terms of power, and demonstrates that concepts of power and entitlement are inextricably bound up in English self-definition. She concludes by examining the implications for social scientific practice of an insider studying her own culture and the political ramifications of such studies for a pluralistic, multicultural society such as Canada. Greenhill's methods, concepts, and conclusions have much to offer practitioners in the fields of folklore, Canadian studies, ethnic studies, anthropology, and women's studies.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

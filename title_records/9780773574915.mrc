His post-war experience took him to the top of the medical profession and appointments as chief of the Department of Surgery at McGill and surgeon-in-chief at the Montreal General Hospital. In 1962 Robertson was named principal of McGill University, a position he held for eight years during one of the most unsettling periods in the university's history. Apart from the usual demanding job of running the university, Robertson was forced to deal with political upheaval, student unrest and revolt, and defending the rights of the English-speaking minority in Quebec. While all around him university leaders cracked under the pressures, Robertson persisted until workable governance solutions were put in place at McGill. Rocke Robertson: Surgeon and Shepherd of Change is a compelling portrait of a remarkable man who handled the greatest challenge of his career - running a primarily English-speaking university in Quebec during the Quiet Revolution - with courage, wisdom, and success.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

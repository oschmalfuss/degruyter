In the past half-century, California has been both model and anti-model for the nation and often the world, first in its high level of government and public services-schools, universities, highways-more lately for its dysfunctional government, deteriorating services, and sometimes regressive public policies. Schrag's incisive analysis of the state's political, demographic, and fiscal realities vividly demonstrates that it has been struggling with a range of problems for a generation. The author deftly shows that California's ability to forge its culturally and ethnically diverse population into a successful democracy will be of crucial importance not only to America, but to the world. He also explains how many current "solutions" exacerbate the very problems they're supposed to solve and analyzes a variety of possible state and federal policy alternatives to restore accountable government and a vital democracy to the nation's largest state and world's fifth largest economy. Among the issues that Schrag tackles:* The impact of Latino and Asian immigration and the emergence of California as the first large majority minority state* The globalization of California's economy and culture* The growing reliance of voters on the initiative, referendum, and recall processes* The increasing instability of elected government * California as cultural avant-garde, from hippies to gay marriage  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

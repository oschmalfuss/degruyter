Social Interaction and Teacher Cognition is the first book to use a discursive psychological perspective to examine teacher cognitions. Informed by conversation analysis (CA), the book offers a close examination of cognition-in-interaction in three distinctive aspects: learning to teach, novice and expert teachers’ cognition, and interactive decision making. The book views cognition as a socially constructed and contextual process, and treats interaction as a framework that deals with psychological matters in a public and visible way. It will be of particular relevance to those researching teacher cognition in EFL contexts and will appeal to anyone interested in the study of classroom interaction.Features a three part structure of survey, analysis and application Takes a discursive psychological approach to teacher cognitions Uses conversation analysis to examine cognition-in-interaction Provides detailed examples of language in interaction in EFL contexts  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

A service desk is a one-stop destination for enquiries, requests and reporting issues, ensuring continuing use of IT services without disruption. They have become intrinsic in modern organisations. A service desk makes prioritising and responding to customer enquiries much more efficient, saving time and money. More and more organisations are understanding that customer satisfaction is key to developing their business. The Service Desk Handbook - A guide to service desk implementation, management and support provides operational guidance for implementing, managing and supporting service desks in the enterprise. It will help service desk teams in adopting ITIL® to accomplish their tasks while making the necessary adaptations as per their organisation’s needs. Suitable for service desk agents, supervisors and managers, as well as project managers and senior management looking to revise processes, this book will help readers get a service desk unit off the ground and act as a key reference guide once the service desk has been implemented. Topics covered include: • Planning for a service desk; • Telephony and tooling; • The service desk team; • Documentation; • Performance measures; and • Technology considerations – artificial intelligence and platforms and tools.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

Practising, in other words, gives us three kinds of time instead of one. Practising involves an interweaving of differences expressing themselves among intentional repetitions. By engaging in practising, we open times other than our habitual presents, we slip the binds of identity and we thin out our relation with behaviours that shut out the future.Whether you practise already, are curious about embarking, or are a reader of Deleuze, this book – for makers, thinkers, lovers and activists – is a rigorous account of why practising is hard to say, why it works and why it matters.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

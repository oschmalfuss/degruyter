Thomson’s poetry ranks with Sorley MacLean’s as among the best in the Gaelic language, and he contributed to the preservation and development of the language as an editor, journalist, scholar, and activist. As well as founding and steering the most important modern Gaelic magazine, Gairm, he instigated a number of ventures aimed at promoting Gaelic and had major impact on Gaelic studies as an academic subject. His vision of the Gaelic revival is characterised by high aesthetic standards, organisational and economic shrewdness, openness to second-language users, support for Scottish political independence and a broad European outlook. This is the very first book-length study devoted to Thomson and it explores his career within the context of the history of the Gaelic revival in Scotland and other minority-language movements in Europe.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

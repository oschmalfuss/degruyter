Philip Hunt, rector of St Peter’s Bedford from 1799, who accompanied firstly Lord Elgin to Greece, and secondly the 6th Duke of Bedford to Ireland as his secretary and chaplain. Following his appointment as a justice of the peace in Bedfordshire, Hunt concerned himself with the running of Bedford prison and penal reform.Samuel Whitbread II is the subject of the third and fourth essays. Appeals to him from prisoners awaiting transportation leads to a discussion of the conditions in the hulks. The unfortunate consequences of his attempts to raise the level of literacy of militiamen is also recounted.Finally, there is a brief account of local law and order in the 1830s which led to the establishment of the county police force in 1840.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

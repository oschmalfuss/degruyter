These texts offer compelling witness to the challenges of a community’s need to honor memory and experience. They provide evidence towards the formation and sustenance of Christian identity in the midst of Persian society and culture. Above all, each draws upon scriptural and monastic traditions to weave distinctive portraits of notable literary quality.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

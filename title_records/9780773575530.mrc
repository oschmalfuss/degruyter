Although institutional factors such as the defects of the original constitution and the sometimes questionable interpretations of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are given due attention, Stevenson emphasizes the political economy of Canada, including its relationship with the United States, and the vitality of Quebec nationalism as the major reasons Canada has not achieved the same level of centralization and stability as other federations in the industrialized world. This updated edition of Unfulfilled Union includes a new introduction that discusses the extensive changes that have taken place in Canadian federalism since that time.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

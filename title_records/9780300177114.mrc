"Brilliant, . . . remarkable, . . . highly entertaining. . . . Only Mack Smith could have told what is finally so shabby a story with this combination of learning and bravura."-Nicholas Richardson, Sunday Times "A brilliant narrative history of the political role of the kings of Italy. It is based on an immense range of sources."-Philip Mansel, Daily Telegraph "Mack Smith is the leading writer in English on nineteenth- and twentieth-century Italian history. . . . [He] has now written a study of the Italian monarchy that subjects the four kings of united Italy to [. . . a] . . . debunking treatment. He shows how indispensable the monarchy was for the working of the Italian political system, but also how it was ultimately disastrous."-James Joll, New York Review of Books "A welcome addition to libraries in the English-speaking world. . . . Denis Mack Smith shows masterful command of political and diplomatic sources and balanced historical judgment."-Clara M. Lovett, American Historical Review "A book to be read and enjoyed. It is urbane [and] stylish."-Richard Bosworth, International History Review   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

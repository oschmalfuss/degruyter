This volume discusses the various types of educational organizations, their purposes, the scope and nature of their activities, and their contributions to education. It includes professional organizations, and a wide variety of groups with a direct or peripheral interest in education in its broad definition.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

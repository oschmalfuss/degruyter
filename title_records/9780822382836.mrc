As scholars and readers increasingly question the theoretical models used to describe the concepts of "mimesis" and "representation," this book describes how the actor's stage presentation affects the actor's representational role and the ways in which viewers experience Shakespearean tragedy.Michael Mooney draws on the work of East German critic Robert Weimann and his concept of figurenposition-the correlation between an actor's stage location and the speech, action, and stylization associated with that position-to understand the actor/stage location relationship in Shakespeare's plays. In his examination of the original staging of Shakespeare's tragedies, Mooney looks at the traditional interplay between a downstage "place" and upstage "location" to describe the difference between non-illusionistic action (often staged near the audience) and the illusionistic, localized action that characterizes mimetic art.The innovative and insightful approach of Shakespeare's Dramatic Transactions brings together the techniques of performance criticism and the traditional literary study of Shakespearean tragedy. In showing how the distinctions of stage location illuminate the interaction among language, representation, Mooney's compelling argument enhances our understanding of Shakespeare and the theater.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 12.

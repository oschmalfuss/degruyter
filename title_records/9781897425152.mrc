In the writings of his persona “ Tex,” Vernon-Wood created an image of the frontier that blended the West of his guiding experiences with the old West as imagined by those who flocked to the Canadian and American frontiers in search of adventure in an uncivilized wilderness. Editors Gow and Rak, guide the reader through this collection of Vernon-Wood's stories, providing a framework for both the writer and his alter ego, Tex.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

The book: Introduces the concepts of Cloud computing and the associated security threats; Explains key security architectures and how they can be applied to Cloud services; and Covers security considerations for the different Cloud service models: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service) and FaaS (Function as a Service). Cloud computing represents a major change to the IT services landscape, but it also introduces changes to the risk landscape, which need to be understood and addressed. The flexibility of Cloud computing does not come without compromise or risk. Security remains a major concern for CIOs (chief information officers) considering a move to Cloud-based services. This book gives organisations pragmatic guidance on how to achieve consistent and cohesive security across their IT services – regardless of whether those services are hosted on-premises, on Cloud services or using a combination of both. This guidance in Securing Cloud Services – A pragmatic guide is provided through the application of a Security Reference Model to the different Cloud delivery models – IaaS, PaaS and SaaS – and also considers the changes in approach required to work securely with the newer FaaS model. Part 1 introduces the concepts embodied within Cloud computing, describes the associated security threats and lists some of the leading industry initiatives dedicated to improving the security of Cloud services. Part 2 introduces security architecture concepts and a conceptual Security Reference Model. This model is then applied to the different Cloud service models to show how the conceptual security services within the reference model can be delivered for each Cloud service model. This book will help organisations looking to implement Cloud services aimed at the enterprise – such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and Salesforce – and to do so in a risk-managed manner. It is aimed at business decision makers, senior IT stakeholders, enterprise architects, information security professionals.

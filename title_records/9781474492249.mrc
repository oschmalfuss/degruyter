With the emergence of urban guerrilla warfare in 1971 – spearheaded by Marxist People’s Fadai Guerrillas (PFG) – dissident artists created symbolic works that popularised the militants’ ideas through artistic depictions and tropes, while portraying the militants as immortal freedom-fighters. The arts of defiance thus swayed young educated Iranians, as well as certain layers of the public, to perceive the state through the eyes of its most radical critiques: militant dissidents.By closely examining and interpreting the poetry, short fiction, songs and films of the 1960s and 1970s, this book uncovers how militant action was translated into artistic expressions and vice versa. It also explores how the PFG (and other) militants – who were few in number – were able to acquire a ‘heroic’ dimension in the eyes of the public, portraying a symbolic image of defiance far beyond their actual militant existence.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

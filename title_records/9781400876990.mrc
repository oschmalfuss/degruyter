Here is a comprehensive history of these controversies during the crucial period from the death of Archbishop Lanfranc in 1089 to the end of the reign of Henry I in 1135. The greater part of the book is concerned with the pontificate of Archbishop Anselm (1093-1109) and includes the first substantial account of the episcopal career of this famous theologian. In a concluding chapter, the obscure period in the history of the English Church from 1109 to 1135 is investigated, and the methods by which Henry I reasserted royal authority over the Church are indicated.Originally published in 1958.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

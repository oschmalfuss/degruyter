In Strong, Beautiful and Modern, Charlotte Macdonald shows how governments encouraged citizens to be healthier and more active and thereby reinforced the cultural ties of the Empire. Alongside these state-sponsored efforts was a growing emphasis from business, the medical establishment, and popular culture on the importance of having "a better body." At a time when government concern over public health issues such as obesity is once again on the rise, Macdonald offers valuable lessons as to why the first national fitness drive was ultimately a failure. Drawing on extensive research, Strong, Beautiful and Modern is a lively investigation into the way people and their governments think about health and well-being, and how historical views have shaped our modern life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

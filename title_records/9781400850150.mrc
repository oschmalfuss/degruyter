In short, philology was the queen of the human sciences. How did it become little more than an archaic word?In Philology, the first history of Western humanistic learning as a connected whole ever published in English, James Turner tells the fascinating, forgotten story of how the study of languages and texts led to the modern humanities and the modern university. The humanities today face a crisis of relevance, if not of meaning and purpose. Understanding their common origins-and what they still share-has never been more urgent.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

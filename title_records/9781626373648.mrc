Smith begins with a brief history of early U.S.-Mexico relations, focusing on the Texas Secession, the Mexican War, and the Gadsden Purchase. By 1853, one-half of what used to be Mexico had become one-third of what is now the United States, and for a full century, strained ties between the two countries were more the rule than the exception. But, Smith observes, the lop-sided algebra has been transformed, and today we see a growing web of interrelationships that has created an inevitable partnership. This evolution is explored in a series of chapters on contemporary issues affecting the partnership: globalization, the process of democratization in Mexico, Mexican immigration to the U.S., illegal narcotics trafficking, and a myriad of trade, labor, and environmental issues. Then, looking forward, the book concludes with a discussion of trends in Mexico-U.S. relations, including the impact of domestic changes in both countries and of the proposed Free Trade Agreement for the Americas (FTAA).  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

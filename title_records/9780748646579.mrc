It investigates the complex experiences of English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish soldiers alike during the often-controversial Operation Banner 1969-2007. The experiences of these soldiers raise many important and difficult questions on war and policy. When do 'troubles', riots and insurgency become war? How does a liberal state respond to an internal war within its own borders? How does it decide on its rules of engagement for its armed forces?Featuring key interviews with former soldiers, paramilitaries and Special Branch detectives, amongst other key actors, the authors attempt to answer these questions and enhance our knowledge of conflict resolution by providing a deep analysis of one of the most significant British military operations since the Second World War.Key Features First title to analyse the role of British Army in Northern Ireland Draws on new primary sources including soldiers' diaries, log-sheets, interviews and previously unreleased MOD documentsRelevant to former members of the armed forces, particularly those who served in Northern Ireland (a demographic of over 300,000)  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

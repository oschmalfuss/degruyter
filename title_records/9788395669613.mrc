Collected Papers. This book includes eight chapters reflecting various approaches towards the theme of play for children with disabilities that characterised the work of the members of the COST Action TD1309 "LUDI-Play for Children with Disabilities": barriers and facilitators to play, guidelines on accessibility and usability of toys and technologies, literature reviews and parents' and studies on educators' perspectives on play are presented. Alongside these multifaceted points of view, some theoretical aspects emerged as a common background: the ICF-CY theoretical perspective, the vision of "play for the sake of play" and play as a fundamental right.

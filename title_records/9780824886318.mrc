Offering dozens of suggestions on how to negotiate a fair settlement with your spouse, it answers questions about alimony, child custody and support, property division, and tax and debt responsibilities. An entire chapter is devoted to the special problems of military personnel. If you are already divorced, it offers suggestions on how to seek modifications in alimony, child custody, or child support. There is even a chapter on pre- and postmarital agreements and palimony. Not intended as a substitute for an attorney, this book will, however, give you a broad understanding of the divorce process in Hawaii and the knowledge of how to fully protect your rights. Regardless of the circumstances, the combination of an informed client and an experienced family law attorney will minimize the cost of divorce, smooth the process, and prevent future problems.Originally published in 1986.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

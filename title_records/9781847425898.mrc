This path-breaking book explores the complex relationship between family change and public policy responses in EU member states and candidate countries. After comparing the major socio-economic changes of the late 20th century in Europe and their impact on family and working life, it analyses both the reactions of policy makers and users as they respond to change and the perceptions families have of public policy and its relative importance in their lives.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

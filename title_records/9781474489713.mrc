Autobiographical discourses that emerge as part of national revolutionary struggles make audible Arab women’s voices and experiences, foregrounding women as active social and political agents and redefining conventions of self-representation and narration.Drawing on autobiographical and postcolonial theories, Contemporary Arab Women’s Life Writing and the Politics of Resistance examines contemporary Arab women’s life writing as sites for the articulation of resistance to interlocking power structures and sociocultural and representational norms. Looking comparatively at subgenres of memoir, auto-portrait, testimony, diary and digital life writing across different linguistic and national contexts, this book explores why resistance is important when writing about the self for Arab women and how it is articulated through experimental formal and thematic approaches to the autobiographical genre.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

This opposition transcended the orthodox ideological divisions, making temporary allies of traditional adversaries in the Party. Even Wilson’s threats either to resign, or call a general election, if his MPs and Ministers failed to support him and Castle, were treated with derision. His colleagues called Wilson’s bluff, and forced him to abandon the legislation, in return for a ‘solemn and binding’ pledge by the trade unions to ‘put their own house in order’ in tackling strikes.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

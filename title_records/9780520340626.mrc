There is some apparent rediscovery (and renaming) of old ideas, but the process is made palatable and worthwhi le by the crispness of the discussion and the un wavering penetration to the root of each issue as it arises. Most difficult problems in the social sciences, the authors note, have no definitive solutions, but simply outcomes. This book deserves a niche among the classic works in the business income literature as a significant milestone on the road to whatever outcome the future holds.";--The Journal of Business ";Professors Edwards and Bell give us a most satisfying study of different concepts of business income. It is rare to find authors so much at home in both economics and accounting. As they themselves suggest, time may show that their programme needs amendment; but they state the problem clearly and provide an excellent starting point. In passing, they give help on many other questions--when to replace plant, how to measure depreciation, which rate of compound interest to use in budgets, and so on. Beyond doubt their book is the most wise and original contribution to accounting theory since Professor Bonbright wrote 'The Valuation of Property' a quarter of a century ago.";--The Economist  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

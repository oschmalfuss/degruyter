It examines a selection of cult and classic British titles made at the time of Hollywood’s active involvement in the domestic film production, with case studies from a number of genres. The book investigates the ways in which these ‘60s and early ‘70s films are remade by Hollywood in the new millennium by focusing in particular on how class and gender representations are updated to accommodate for cultural, societal and technological transformations. It shows a tendency for remakes to revise old power dynamics by means of gender reversal and to replace class conflicts with sex wars. Since all the British originals feature iconic British actors, analysing their Hollywood alter-egos becomes another important indicator of adaptation strategies where casting American or British actors determines the remake’s gender politics and genre markers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

It is for those who are currently in recovery and looking for a way to shift their recovery into a higher gear—from just surviving and muddling through to becoming the absolute best version of themselves, from mere recovery to Integral Recovery.Integral Recovery is the groundbreaking application of Integral Theory to addiction. It brings alcohol and drug treatment into the twenty-first century by combining the best of the treatment modalities of the past with the latest knowledge, techniques, and neurotechnologies in order to ensure a more holistic and lasting recovery. In addition to providing an illuminating and inspiring map to the path of recovery, Integral Recovery teaches life-changing practices that initiate the addict on a journey of healing, transformation, and awakening, offering the possibility of a lifetime of health, joy, and sobriety.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

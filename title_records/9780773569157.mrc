After she left Newfoundland, Luther became one of the pioneers of occupational therapy in the United States, spending the rest of her professional life as director of occupational therapy at the Butler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. Edited by Ronald Rompkey, author of the most authoritative biography of Grenfell, Luther's journal provides an unusually intimate account of Wilfred Grenfell during these four years B his idiosyncracies, his attempts to meet the needs of the community, his rescue from a floating ice pan, his marriage B and brings to life the Newfoundlanders with whom she worked.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

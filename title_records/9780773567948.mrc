Once saving money becomes a goal in itself, rather than "something we do on the side," public policy has little chance of survival. In subsequent chapters introducing the five key areas, Dr. Richard Cruess (McGill) and Dr. Sylvia Cruess (McGill) write on the physician's role in society; the Honourable Bob Rae tackles the political challenges of health care in the consumer era; Professor Raisa Deber (Toronto) looks at the rightful place of economics in health policy; Sister Nuala Kenny (Dalhousie) examines the ethical dilemmas we face; and Professor Bernard Dickens (Toronto) describes how current health care issues are perceived by the law. Other contributors represent a "who's who" of Canada's most highly recognized academics, professionals, and policy-makers. Also writing on clinical practice are Pat Kelly (PISCES), Dr. Terrence Montague (Merck Frosst), and Dr. Hugh Scully (Cardiac Care Network). The Honourable Monique Bégin, Mark Wainberg (International AIDS Society), and Rev. Lois Wilson (Senator, Canadian Parliament) write on politics. Nathalie St. Pierre (Fédération Nationale des Associations des Consommateurs du Québec), Devidas Menon (Institute of Pharmaco-Economics), and Dr. John Wade (Former Deputy Minister of Health, Manitoba) discuss economics. Tim Caufield (Alberta), Maurice McGregor (McGill), and Lesley Degner (St. Boniface Research Centre) consider ethical issues. Marcia Rioux (Roeher Institute), Jamie Cameron (York), and Henry Dinsdale (Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons) deal with the law. Do We Care? is a must-read for anyone involved in decision-making about the future of Canadian health care -- and for all of us who are affected by these decisions. Do We Care? is the result of a conference entitled "Directions for Canadian Health Care: A Framework for Sound Decisions" which was held in Toronto in October of 1998.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

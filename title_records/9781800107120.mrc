The introduction gives an account of the improvements to the river by, eg sluices, scouring the river, ditches and tow paths etc, and of the people who undertook them. The story is told through transcriptions of 104 documents from the Francklin manuscripts and one from the Whitbread manuscripts at Bedfordshire Archives.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

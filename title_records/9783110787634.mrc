The Boardroom, however, takes a different approach to leadership development by emphasizing the unique socio-cultural and judicial features as well as idiosyncratic board structures in Asia, particularly in an Indonesian context. The principles of good corporate governance are accepted across borders, but the implementation and translation of transparency, fairness, accountability, and responsibility can differ quite distinctly from one country to another. Amidst global competitive turbulence, socio-economic volatility, and geopolitical uncertainty, The Boardroom analyses how Asian boardroom leaders steer organizations and how boards can be more effective. Boardmembers - appointed and entrusted by their owners - are guardians with a fiduciary duty to safeguard an organization and prepare it for a viable and sustainable future.Business managers, investors, academics, students and those interested in doing business in Asia will benefit from The Boardroom’s practical insights and recommendations to improve corporate governance and strengthen competitive advantage. "The Boardroom" - a book written by my predecessor Dr Tanri Abeng and his co-author Prof. Dr. Peter Verhezen who both combine practical experience and academic in-depth research - gives a good overview of what can and should be expected from a board. The authors describe the generic accepted governance principles, but rightfully claim the need to translate them into specific rules and regulations that make sense for Indonesian and other Asian companies.Erick Thohir, The Minister of State-Owned Enterprises of the Republic of Indonesia Understanding the dynamics of successful organizations is like being on a quest. It probably never ends. Organizations are open and social systems that cannot be managed or governed using simple theories and recipes. Hence, this book invites you to start your own leadership journey and become more mindful of your role in the functioning of a company.Prof. Dr. Koen Vandenbempt, Dean of the Faculty of Business & Economics at the University of Antwerp, Belgium  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

This study of canadian international diplomacy in its first twenty years treats the subject both from a national point of view -- what was Ottawa hoping to achieve? -- and an international one -- how did external events affect Canadian policy? The focus is mainly on political and security aspects of Canadian objectives and reactions -- the framing of the Covenant, the shapers of Canadian politicies particularly in regard to collective security and minorities, and Canada's role in the Manchurian and Ethiopian disputes that broke up the League -- but it also includes an account of a largely forgotten episoide: an appeal to the League from the Six Nation Indians against Canada. The study is based largely on archival sources recently opened in Ottawa and Geneva, and on the personal papers of those involved, including Walter A. Riddell. The activities and influence of O.D. Skelton are also described. It is hoped that this book will serve as the standard work on the topic of Canada's first steps on the formal international stage.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

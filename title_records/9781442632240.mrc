He practiced law in the province before entering politics. In 1896 he was elected to the House of Commons, and in 1901 was chosen leader of the Liberal-Conservative party.After his retirement in 1920, Sir Robert kept on the sidelines of the political debate, although he was often consulted by those in power and was frequently tempted to express his views on current issues. During the last four years of his life, 1933 to 1937, he recorded some of his thoughts and experiences in the form of ‘Letters to Limbo.’ Some of these he read over and revised, others he left as dictated. The wide range of his interests is revealed in the topics: union government for Canada? / reminiscences of household pets / inaccuracy of the press / bestowal of honours in Canada / business conditions in the United States / Dean of Canterbury and Social Credit / appraisal of Sir Arthur Currie / King Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson.All the letters but four are presented in this volume. They reveal some of the inner thoughts and strongest beliefs of Sir Robert, giving an insight into the man and his times. Whimsical and humourous, or serious and well-argued, these letters paint a portrait in words of one of the greatest figures in Canadian history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

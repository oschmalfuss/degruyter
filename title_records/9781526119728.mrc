Procida provides a new approach to the growing history of women and empire by situating women at the centre of the practices and policies of British imperialism. Rebutting interpretations that have marginalized women in the empire, this book demonstrates that women were crucial to establishing and sustaining the British Raj in India from the "High Noon" of imperialism in the late nineteenth century through to Indian independence in 1947.Using three separate modes of engagement with imperialism – domesticity, violence, and race – Procida demonstrates the many and varied ways in which British women, particularly the wives of imperial officials, created a role for themselves in the empire. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including memoirs, novels, interviews, and government records, the book examines how marriage provided a role for women in the empire, looks at the home as a site for the construction of imperial power, analyses British women's commitment to violence as a means of preserving the empire, and discusses the relationship among Indian and British men and women.Married to the empire is essential reading to students of British imperial history and women's history, as well as those with an interest in the wider history of the British Empire.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

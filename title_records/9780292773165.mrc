These works by this respected children's theatre playwright show Harris's great versatility: in the commedia dell'arte of Androcles and the Lion; the musical melodrama Rags to Riches; the sober, absurd comedy Punch and Judy; the realistic historical drama Steal Away Home; the farce Peck's Bad Boy; and the musical review Yankee Doodle. Each of the six plays exhibits a vital theatricality which is sure to win a child's attention and response. Editor Coleman A. Jennings traces Harris's development as a playwright in a biographical study based on interviews with Harris. This enlightening section treats Harris's philosophy and teaching methods, as well as his creative process.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

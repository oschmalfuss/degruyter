From avoiding unnecessary arguments with your spouse to coaching a valuable, yet difficult employee, Adubato’s essays delve into the key factors that motivate people to act and respond the way that they do. You will find answers to some of the most common questions about public speaking as well as advice on overcoming its anxieties. Whether the forum is a PTA meeting or a large professional function, essays explore topics such as: Why even practiced speakers sometimes experience stage fright How to keep your audience awake and interested in what you are saying You will learn essential skills for interacting in the workplace, including: How to negotiate a good deal and still be honest and straight How to keep team projects from falling apart How to conduct yourself in confrontational situations, such as receiving a public insult Drawing on examples set by public figures, including Bill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani, Mario Cuomo, Martha Stewart, Jack Welch, Joe Torre, and many others, Adubato addresses the unique communication challenges that those in leadership positions face.

For instance, · Why do we hide behind e-mail messages when we have something very difficult to say? · How does communication deteriorate when cell phones and e-mail are competing for our attention? Finally, Adubato reminds us that communicating at home is no less important or any less difficult than communicating in public or at work. From contemporary challenges to age-old questions, essays explore: · How you can more effectively talk with your kids about war and terrorism · What forms of persuasion are more effective than nagging Filled with timely examples and practical suggestions, Make the Connection is a must-read for everyone looking to improve their professional and personal relationships.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

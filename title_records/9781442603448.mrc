Policing and Gendered Justice provides a comprehensive analysis of women and policing in North America. It further enhances the body of knowledge on gender and policing by bridging the gap between theory and practice, and by using an empowerment approach to encourage discussion of the need to make ideological and structural changes and the need to promote social action and social change. Through a critical, feminist examination of gender and policing, and through a comparative analysis of women in policing in Canada and the United States, Corsianos offers a unique and original account of women police officers' experiences and the role that feminist analyses can play in providing greater justice. Only a handful of books have focused on the relationship between gender and policing globally, let alone within North America, making this book a necessary resource for those studying in Criminology and Criminal Justice. For professors wishing to integrate a discussion of gender into a policing course, or for students wanting to better understand the complexities of gender and policing, Policing and Gendered Justice works as an informative, innovative approach to addressing gender differences in the profession.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

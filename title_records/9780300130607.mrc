Yet melanoma is readily detectable and curable in its early stages, and it is a disease that often can be prevented by avoiding excessive sun exposure.This book is a complete guide to melanoma for anyone newly diagnosed with this frightening disease and for others who are concerned about detecting and preventing it. Featuring color photographs that show normal and malignant spots on the skin, and the latest medical information on getting proper treatment and lowering the risk of developing the disease, the book is filled with facts that can save lives. Health writer Catherine M. Poole, also a melanoma survivor, teams up with world-renowned melanoma expert Dr. DuPont Guerry IV to provide practical advice for patients, their families, and their health care providers.Readers will find in this book the answers to such important questions as:• What do early and late melanoma look like?• When is a mole a problem?• Is sunscreen the best way to prevent melanoma?• Who is most likely to get melanoma?• What does the pathology report on a biopsy mean?• Are there different treatments? Which is most effective?• Is there hope when melanoma has spread within the body?• Where can accurate melanoma information be found on the Internet?  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

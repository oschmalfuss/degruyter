Touching on various themes in environmental ethics, value theory and political philosophy, including deep ecology, eco-feminism and eco-anarchism, this book argues, against prevailing wisdom, that liberalism can embrace a non-anthropocentric, non-instrumental view of nature. Indeed, Hailwood argues that conceptual resources exist within liberal pluralism - the ideas of "neutrality", "anti-expressivism" and "otherness" - for a thoroughly ecocentric perspective. Engaging with the works of Wissenburg, Carter, Bookchin, Rawls, and many others, Hailwood develops in this book a recognizably liberal pluralist theory that encompasses a strong commitment to the non-instrumental value of independent nature. The book begins by outlying the charge of anthropocentrism against liberalism. The author then discusses historical versions of natural/political order parallels and Mill's objection to "natural lessons". The core chapters then examine nature's otherness as a ground of value, the criticisms of holistic/deep ecological views, and the pluralist critique of liberalism and the common ground between them. The final chapter summarizes the theoretical position and discusses some of the practical implications.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

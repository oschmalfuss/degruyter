Nazarea-Sandoval investigates the processes and patterns of decision making which affect land use, crop choice, and day-to-day resource management. Indigenous knowledge, she demonstrates, is a vital resource, even though it is unevenly distributed and therefore not equally enabling.Nazarea-Sandoval uses historical analysis, in-depth ethnographic research, and decision-making models to probe the ways different kinds of households and individuals in a rural Philippine community responded to changing social, economic, and ecological conditions. In chronological order she considers the transition from landlord-owned and tenanted riceland to post-land reform and the amortization of owner-operated small holdings. She also treats the diversification from rice monoculture to combined rice-aquaculture and the influx of migrant workers seeking livelihood opportunities. These transitions, she shows, have ushered in new options and offer a valuable opportunity for studying agricultural decision making in the context of ongoing rural development.Analyzing the effects of change on different classes and genders in an apparently homogeneous farming community, she depicts the farmers not just as victims of the process, but as actors in their own right, who not only absorb the impact of change but also redirect it.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

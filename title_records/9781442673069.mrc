He wrote on subjects as diverse as technology, abortion, Canadian politics and nationalism, and the war in Vietnam, and was claimed equally by rightist and leftist causes. Now, more than a decade after his death, George Grant's writings continue to stimulate, challenge, and inspire.Grant's legacy includes six books and more than two hundred articles, as well as numerous broadcast transcripts, extensive correspondence, and a wealth of unpublished lectures, essays, and notes. In this volume, Arthur Davis has collected all the important material from the 1950s when Grant did his first teaching and writing at Dalhousie University. Through this projected eight-volume series, Grant's published and unpublished writings, including his complete correspondence, will be brought together for the first time. The texts are annotated, and each volume includes an introduction to the period that it covers. The series will not only make it possible to see the whole pattern of Grant's thought, but will also invite a reconsideration of the nature and importance of his work. George Grant is one of the most important Canadian philosophers of the later twentieth century, and his collected writings are a significant contribution to Canadian political thought and Canadian history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 08.

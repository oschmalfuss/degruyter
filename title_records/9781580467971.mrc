In this book, Drew Massey explores how Kirkpatrick's career as an editor of music shaped the musicand legacies of some of the great American modernists, including Aaron Copland, Ross Lee Finney, Roy Harris, Hunter Johnson, Charles Ives, Robert Palmer, and Carl Ruggles. Drawing on oral histories, interviews, and Kirkpatrick's own extensive archives, Massey carefully reconstructs Kirkpatrick's collaborations with such luminaries, displaying his editorial practice and inviting reconsideration of many of the most important debates in American modernism --for example, the self-fashioning of young composers during the 1940s, the cherished myth of Ruggles as a composer in communion with the "timeless," and Ives's status as a pioneer of modernist techniques. First winner (November 2014) of ASCAP's Virgil Thomson Award for Outstanding Music Criticism. Drew Massey is an Assistant Professor of Music at Binghamton University.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

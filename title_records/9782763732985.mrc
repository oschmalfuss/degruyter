As a result, after a few information sessions, the community is faced with a done deal, and has to live with decisions that have been made by others, without having the chance to give its opinion. The Little Guidebook on the Extensive Consultation; Creation and Cultural Transmission by and with the Communities, native and non-native, aims to help reversing the trend by proposing cultural projects’ models arising from a real consensus-building approach. It is a ‘’toolbox’’ to ease the convergence of the driving forces of a community within a common approach, and through a process that springs from the desire of realizing a cultural project. It provides support to project officers, workshop leaders, partners or decisionmakers for the various aspects entailed in making a cultural project. It offers principles, thoughts, and tools to facilitate the population’s participation to its own cultural development. The approach of this guide focuses on art creation, design, video, and museography. Many work methodologies are explained. They enable carriers of culture to express themselves, and to formulate the message and the heritage that they want to pass on by themselves. The principles, thoughts, and tools provided in this guide are based on experience gained over the last 25 years by La Boîte Rouge vif. Since 1991, it works in cultural and mediation transmission through consensus building and creation. Its mission is to develop innovative individual and community development strategies while respecting diversity.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

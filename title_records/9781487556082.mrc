Using Heidegger’s work with Greek thinking as a springboard, the book shows how the covering over of this essential thread happened. Kenneth Maly provides a frame by which those not trained in philosophy and phenomenology of experience can grasp the wider import of this rethinking of Greek philosophy. The book delves deep into key questions, preparing readers for extensive and more technical work with the key Greek words and their meanings, hidden for centuries. It includes a significant investigation of how this task requires a different way of language, how early Western thinking mirrors non-Western Daoism and Buddhism, and how quantum physics gets to the same place in its "philosophy," with an emphasis on the work of David Bohm. In doing so, the book reveals how Daoism, Buddhism, the quantum potential of quantum physics, and Heidegger’s being-beyng are all mirrored in Greek philosophy, above all in early Greek thinking.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

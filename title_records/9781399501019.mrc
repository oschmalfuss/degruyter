Entries range from Theodor Adorno and Anthropology through to Materiality and Memory and on to Aby Warburg and Witnessing. Researchers already familiar with his work, but who want to develop a multi-faceted and more comprehensive understanding of the philosophical and cultural references woven into his thought, will gain deeper knowledge of the nuances of his conceptual apparatus, given the interreferential and intertextual aspects of his work.The dictionary identifies and explains his key figures, inspirations and philosophical metaphors as well as introduces Didi-Huberman’s polemics with other contemporary philosophers, including Giorgio Agamben and Jacques Rancière. Entries on concepts and motifs from Didi-Huberman’s major texts that are (as of yet) not translated into English - Ce que nous voyons, ce qui nous regarde (1992), and Ninfa moderna (2002) - are also included.This is your one-stop, go-to resource for learning more about the innovative, exciting work of Georges Didi-Huberman.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 03.

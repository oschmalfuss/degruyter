It scrutinises the historical, cultural, political, and socio-economic dimensions within which schools, colleges and universities operate.Featuring 67 new authors and updated and expanded throughout, this fifth edition is so substantially updated from the previous edition as to practically constitute a new book. The contributors have drawn on up-to-date research and professional analysis to give fresh insights into recent educational developments – in particular during the period from the Independence referendum in 2014, through the complexities of the post-Brexit years. These have been years when education has faced difficult challenges and the writers analyse the many factors affecting teachers’ efforts to operate during uncertain times.This latest edition contains forthright and informed commentary on every aspect of education and is essential reading for anyone concerned to know how education currently ‘works’ in Scotland.New Topics for the 5th EditionPoverty, class and inter-generational disadvantageDigital education in schoolsChildren’s rightsGovernance reforms in the universities of ScotlandEducating migrant and refugee pupilsLGBTI issues in schoolingA pupil’s experience of Scottish educationAn alternative vocational pathway: a model for the futureA Journalist’s perspective on the future of Scottish EducationThe direction of post-school education in ScotlandPraise for the First Edition‘The most comprehensive treatment ever of education in Scotland.’– Peter Scott, Scottish Affairs‘This book tells us comprehensively how Scottish education works.

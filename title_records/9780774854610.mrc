In this major new work, esteemed fisheries expert Thomas Quinn distills from the vast scientific literature the essential information on the behaviour and ecology of Pacific salmon, including steelhead and cutthroat trout. Unlike other books that examine only selected life stages, habitats, or species, this book -- richly illustrated with beautiful photographs and original artwork -- thoroughly covers the complete life cycle, emphasizing common themes and differences among the various species of salmon. Representing the range of species and geographic regions, Quinn includes examples from classic studies by pioneers of salmon biology and from the most current research in order to illustrate the important features of salmon life history and behaviour and the complex physical, biological, and human factors that affect them. He introduces salmon and trout as a group, with a brief description of each species, and compares them to other fishes. The book then follows salmon on their amazing homeward migration from the open ocean, through the complex coastal waters, upstream to the precise location where they were spawned years earlier. The Behavior and Ecology of Pacific Salmon and Trout explains the patterns of mate choice, the competition for nest sites, and the fate of the salmon after their death. It describes the lives of offspring during the months they spend incubating in gravel, growing in fresh water, and migrating out to sea to mature. Quinn emphasizes the importance of salmon to humans and natural ecosystems and the need to integrate sound biology into conservation efforts. This thorough, up-to-date survey should be on the shelf of everyone with a professional or personal interest in Pacific salmon and trout. Written in a technically accurate but engaging style, it will appeal to a wide range of readers, including students, anglers, biologists, conservationists, legislators, and armchair naturalists.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

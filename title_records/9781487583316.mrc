The ultra-left in the Canadian political spectrum, has been almost totally overlooked. This study is the first to trace the origins and growth of the Party during the initial decade of its existence. Its history is of particular interest because it is unique among Canadian political bodies in drawing its inspiration as well as practical advice from an external source: The Communist International which subordinated the Canadian party to Moscow and to the Communist Party of the Society Union. The Communist party is the only Canadian political body which can trace its origins to an epochal event such as the Russian Revolution. Soldiers of the International covers the origins and growth of the Canadian party in detail and shows that its programme and development paralleled those of other Communist parties throughout the world. Based upon primary sources, this fascinating account emphasizes both the importance of the first decade of the existence of the Canadian party and its failure to establish itself in these crucial years between World War I and the advent of the Depression. The author discusses this failure in view of the Party's unpreparedness and lack of support in the 1930's in conditions that ostensibly were ideally suited to its philosophy and programme. This informative account ably covers a neglected area in Canadian political history and throws new light on the facets of the political scene in Canada today.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

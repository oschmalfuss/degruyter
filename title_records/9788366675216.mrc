The process is attractive because it avoids large number of operations, high scrap losses and energy consumption associated with conventional manufacturing processes. The technology, though have been extensively applied throughout the world for manufacture of numerous components, still requires to be explored from several perspectives. The objective of the present book is to study, explore and investigate the deformation characteristics during mechanical processing of the sintered materials.

Teaching Selves argues that being a teacher is not a matter of simply adopting a role but rather involves the construction of an identity as a teacher. Focusing on identity, the book tells the stories of six undergraduate students enrolled in a secondary teacher education program at a large state university. Through a qualitative study made up of interviews, observations, and teaching experiences with the subjects over a three-year period, the author explains the process of becoming a teacher, concentrating on the influences of education courses and other features of the teacher education program. Filled with students' stories and personal reflections from the author, Teaching Selves offers a personal vision of what is possible in a very public endeavor—the education of new teachers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

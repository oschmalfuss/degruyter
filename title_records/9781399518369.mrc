By exploring issues of sexuality, religion and mental health, it places Gillies within the broader contexts of the painting and cultural politics of Scotland, Britain and Europe. This is William Gillies as you’ve never experienced him before.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

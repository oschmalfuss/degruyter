This ground-breaking book is the first to analyse its use as an act of war against civilians and international progress away from tacit acceptance toward active rejection of this violation of international law. Exploring international responses to sexual violence in war, it introduces the main historical facts, theoretical terms and legal developments behind UNSC resolutions on women, peace and security and the emerging practice of international law in this area. It identifies best practice in moving beyond accepting rape in war as inevitable to the recognition of tactical rape as a security concern for women, men, states and the international community. Powerful testimonies of victims are included to bring the issue alive, making this a much-needed volume for academic and professional communities.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

However, there is little practical guidance available on the fundamentals of performing qualitative research with documents. This valuable book enables readers to undertake high-quality, robust research using documents as data. Encouraging critical consideration of research design, the book guides readers step-by-step through the process of planning and undertaking a research project based on documentary analysis. It covers selecting a research topic and sample through to analysing and writing up the data. The book includes: • a wealth of case studies demonstrating how lessons can be applied in practice; • summary boxes and suggestions for further reading in each chapter to guide learning; • helpful online resources to facilitate designing your own research. Accessible and comprehensive, this book will be invaluable for both students and researchers alike who are new to documentary analysis. All the resources included in this book are available to download on the book’s webpage at https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/doing-your-research-project-with-documents/online-resources.

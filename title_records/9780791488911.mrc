The contributors focus on the need for critical reflections, which reveal hidden aspects of leadership phenomena, and advocate diverse forms of positive action to improve the condition for women in school settings. As such, this collection challenges the reader to consider the partiality of all perspectives on leadership, as well as future directions for research and practice. It also brings together views of schools and school systems at the macro level, with discussions and case studies focused on the micro levels of school life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

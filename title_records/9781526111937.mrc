The anthology includes poems by twenty-two authors selected according to their literary rigour and with attention to the relevance of their work, a comprehensive introductory study, notes, thorough individual commentaries to the poems, and lists of selected vocabulary and rhetorical terms that provide accessibility to the anthology. The poetic selection is divided into sections and subsections in order to aid its pedagogical intent, covering: the poetry written during the transition to democracy; the emergence of poetry written by women in the 1980s; the Spanish poetic field of the 1990s; the poetry written at the turn of the new millennium; and some of the youngest voices in Spanish poetry today. English-speaking students working in the field of Hispanic literature, but also a more general reader keen on literature written in Spanish language, should thoroughly enjoy this work.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

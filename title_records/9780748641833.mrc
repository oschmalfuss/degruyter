Assuming no background knowledge of programming, the author introduces basic notions and techniques needed for linguistic programming and helps readers to develop their understanding of electronic texts.The book includes many examples based on diverse topics in linguistics in order to demonstrate the applicability of the concepts at the heart of programming. Practical examples are designed to help the reader toIdentify basic issues in handling language data, including Unicode processingConduct simple analyses in morphology/morphosyntax, and phonotacticsUnderstanding techniques for matching linguistic patternsLearn to convert data into formats and data structures suitable for linguistic analysisCreate frequency lists from corpus materials to gather basic descriptive statistics on textsUnderstand, obtain and 'clean up' web-based dataDesign graphical user interfaces for writing more efficient and easy-to-use analysis tools.Two different types of exercise help readers to learn to interpret and understand illustrative sample code, and then develop algorithmic thinking and solution strategies through turning a series of instructions into sample programs. Readers will be equipped with the necessary tools for designing their own extended projects.Key FeaturesIdeal introduction for students of linguistics attempting to process corpus materials or literary texts for dissertations, theses or advanced research workLinguistic examples throughout the text clearly demonstrate the application of programming theory and techniquesCoverage ranging from basic to more complex topics and methodologies enables the reader to work at their own paceTwo chapters on the advantages of modularity and associated issues provide a basis for more advanced projectsA concluding chapter introduces graphical user interfaces, providing a basis for user-friendly programs and multi-lingual analysis."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

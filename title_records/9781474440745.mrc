With case studies of films that reflexively foreground and creatively reimagine the past, including Shirin (2008), Goodbye to Language (2014) and Francofonia (2015), the book demonstrates how the medium of film can look simultaneously backwards and forwards, encountering and reframing the past in the present, and offering new ways of thinking about both film history and contemporary cinema alike.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

This change inherently makes obsolete those laws and policies that assume the breadwinner/homemaker family structure.Should We Worry about Family Change? unpacks the current controversies and larger issues surrounding family change: the nature of family change; the impact of family change on the lives of women; and the need for amendment to our social policies and laws to reflect today's diverse family patterns. Drawing on her vast understanding of the historical development of the family and the social policies that have attempted to meet familial concerns, Lewis comments on such pivotal topics as absent fathers, the increasing economic independence of women, and the effects of the rise of cohabitation.Lewis ultimately suggests that there are policy options available to increase the choices men and women make about their contributions to family life and to promote family responsibility. Drawing on a wide range of literature, cross-national data, and policy approaches, Lewis engages her readers in a highly public and timely debate.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

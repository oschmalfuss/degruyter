With the expectation that in future many more adults will need care and support, ideas have emerged about a ‘transformation’ of adult social care. The focus of this wide-ranging book is on the major themes in policy and provision including personalisation, integration, user participation, the cost of long term care, risk and safeguarding, care quality and workforce issues and is one of the first texts to deal with adult social care as a distinct entity and is an up-to-date source on contemporary government policies, debates and research.The book encourages readers to think critically about decisions being made and about the direction of future policy. The accessible book will be a valuable resource for undergraduate students in Social Policy, Health and Social Care, and Social Work, those taking advanced vocational qualifications in social care and practitioners.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

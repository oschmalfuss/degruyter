What if our modern mythologies are not actually that modern?Using Iran as an example of an ancient civilization with a sustained course of continuity all the way to the present time, this book moves towards a philosophical reflection on the relationship between what we see and feel today when engaging with art, literature and film and what we have otherwise deeply buried in the forgotten layers of our collective consciousness from time immemorial.This is the story of Mashya and Mashyana Unearthed, an exploration of when and where ancient myths become metonymic in varied forms of contemporary cultural and aesthetic representations.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

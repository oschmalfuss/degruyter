From a focus on the representation of oppression in films like The Battle of Algiers, films such as Timbuktu, Nobody Knows About Persian Cats and Chop Shop now contribute to the active formation of political characters and viewers, a form not fully realized until the 21st century due to shifts in information technologies and resulting political organization. This book demonstrates that a contemporary form of political cinema has emerged, centered on the production of subjectivity and networks of protest, which depicts the active formation of political identities that resonates with off-screen protest movements.Key FeaturesDocuments global political cinemas 1990s–2010sArgues for a contemporary shift in understanding political cinemas, beyond Third Cinema and political modernismOffers a new approach to cinematic independence by looking at understudied films, such as North/West African films and Kurdish filmsRevisits the cinematic politics of Gilles Deleuze  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

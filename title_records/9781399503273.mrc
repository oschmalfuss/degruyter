The second are other cultures and literatures which have become sources for direct or indirect loans for Arabic literature. Both sources are essential for our understanding of the nature of contemporary Arabic literary works. The relationship between modern and medieval Arabic literature is indispensable; moreover, the literariness of any Arabic literary text cannot be isolated from the history of Arabic literature. Also, the role and function of Arabic literature, the nature of its literary criticism and scholarship, the relations between religious, political, and other activities within Arab culture and its literary production—all may be modelled in Arab culture in relation to other culture or cultures.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

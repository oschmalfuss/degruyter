Best known for her fictional films - Antamosi, Only the Brave, Head On, The Book of Revelation and Blessed - her work is often bold and confrontational in its exploration of the alienation, estrangement and visceral distresses of those outside the mainstream. In the first major study of the director, Ana Kokkinos: An Oeuvre of Outsiders offers new readings of and across her fictional oeuvre by broadly tracing the deployment of the outsider as an organising motif.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

It argues for the centrality of urban fiction and photography to the decade's experiments in representing daily life. Why the period’s London-set novels were so often described as 'photographic', and what kind of photographs inspired such comparisons? Tracing representations of London by a wide range of 1930s writers and photographers, including Patrick Hamilton, Jean Rhys, George Orwell, and Bill Brandt, the book's chapters are organised around London's spaces of leisure. Teashops, cinemas, and the night clubs of Soho were central to 1930s negotiations of the interrelation between urban life, gender, and class; these settings provide this book both with cultural-historical context and with the basis for its argument about the decade's aesthetic orientations.Key FeaturesPositions London writing as central to British literature of the 1930sArgues that interrelationship between journalistic, photographic, and Naturalist models is key to the decade’s literary aestheticOffers critical readings of neglected and forgotten 1930s writers such as Betty Miller, Norah Hoult, Storm JamesonCombines literary analysis with research into the cultural histories of 1930s London’s spaces of leisure  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

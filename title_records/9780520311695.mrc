The book deals first with the ideas for a documentary film, and shows how they are embodied ina script. It explains how the production unit is assembled, and goes on to describe the mechanism of the camera, the primary instrument of film making. The chapters which follow discuss the important creative process of editing, optical printing, the film library, and negative cutting. A special section deals with the physics of sound, the technical methods of recording it, and the creative uses to which sound can be put in film. A long chapter describes current color processes and 16-mm. techniques. Successive chapters take the reader through all the steps of the production from script to screen and give him clues to what practices he should adopt and what he should avoid. A number of simplified procedures in animation are described here for the first time. The book ends with an annotated bibliography of technical works on film, and an extensive, 1000-word glossary of film terms defined with the needs of the amateur in mind.

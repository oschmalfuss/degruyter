This second edition builds on the first edition’s success at synthesizing the latest theories and practice models; helping and change processes; empirical findings; and practice skills, and demonstrates how these interlinked dimensions contribute to the EPAS 2015-endorsed model of holistic competence.The second edition of Social Work Practice is updated with new empirical findings and foundational information, while also supplementing the text with the concepts and competencies in EPAS 2015. With an overall theme of holistic competence, it incorporates the significant role of cognitive and affective processes in social workers’ professional practice and discusses ways of developing and maintaining a reflective practice. With useful material on interpersonal communication, cross-cultural practice, and the use of technology in one guide, Marion Bogo lays a general foundation for social work practice and professional development.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

It places the poetic imagination of Marvell and his contemporaries - such as John Milton, Henry Vaughan, Abraham Cowley, Margaret Cavendish, William Davenant, and Thomas Fairfax - into the context of the turbulent public events of the time; and demonstrates Marvell's hitherto unnoticed connection with the liberal, rational and sceptical thinkers associated with the Great Tew circle. It also argues that Marvell's "middle way" in theology is bound up with his ambivalence towards the Calvinist God. Takashi Yoshinaka took his D.Phil. at the University of Oxford, and is Professor of English in the Graduate School of Letters, Hiroshima University.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

By means of a comprehensive and penetrating examination of the main elements of Epicurean ethics Phillip Mitsis forces us to reevaluate this widely misunderstood figure in the history of philosophy. Measuring Epicurean doctrines against both their ancient and modern alternatives, Mitsis argues that Epicurus' hedonism, when properly understood in its original philosophical context, is a complex and significant ethical option.Mitsis shows that Epicurus perceived, and brought forward in his writings, a series of conflicts between rival, though individually well founded, claims. Epicurus was ultimately unable to resolve these conflicts, Mitsis says, and therefore the Epicurean "system" cannot be regarded as a consistent whole. Looking closely at the surviving ancient evidence, Mitsis reconstructs the wider theoretical framework of particular Epicurean arguments and proposes new interpretations of Epicurus' accounts of pleasure, human action and responsibility, the virtues, and altruism. Woven through the exposition and criticism of Epicurean positions are illuminating references to later moral philosophers, from Hobbes and Mill to contemporary figures.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 15.

Under the name of borreliosis, the disease is also common in Europe. As Americans have become aware of the hazard they face from Lyme disease, they have become anxious to know how to avoid or control the disease. But the complex ecological interactions of Lyme disease make that extremely difficult. The disease is caused by a microorganism, a spirochete, which is carried by tiny ticks. The ticks, in turn, are transported from place to place by their hosts: humans, deer, white-tailed mice, dogs, lizards, and many other animals and birds. Both ticks and their hosts serve as a reservoir for the disease. As with any tick-borne disease, the best hope of prevention lies in understanding and interrupting the lifecycle of the microorganism, its vectors, and their hosts. This book is the first attempt to survey the natural history, ecology, population dynamics, geography, and environmental management of Lyme disease. Eighteen leading American researchers on Lyme disease explain the current state of knowledge and comment candidly on the theoretical and practical advantages and difficulties with each technique of surveillance, self-protection, and tick control. The book includes suggestions for personal protection against the disease, This is an essential resource for naturalists, ecologists, physicians, nurses, epidemiologists, public health officials, entomologists, veterinarians, pest control operators, wildlife managers, town planners, and anyone concerned with Lyme disease.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

But it is also an inquiry into public moral deliberation and the relationship between economic worth and the value systems of a society. Looking closely at human organ procurement debates, the author offers a critique of neoliberalism in bioethics and asks what kind of society we truly want. While society is directly concerned with the practical question of organ procurement, a better understanding of the rhetoric of advocates and philosophical underpinnings of the debate might indeed improve our public moral deliberation in general and organ policy more specifically. Examining public arguments, this book uses a range of source material, from medical journals to Congressional hearings to New York Times op-eds, to provide the most up-to-date and thorough analysis of the topic. Organs for Sale posits that deciding together on the limits of markets, and on what is and ought to be for sale, sheds light on the moral fiber of our society and what it needs to thrive.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

"Kenney’s work is the first major effort to provide a detailed analysis of the birth of the new industrial field of biotechnology and its impact on universities. . . . Kenney’s book abounds in rich description and valuable conjectures. It also provides important insights into the structural and institutional aspects of the biotechnological revolution. It is informed by an extensive literature including reports form the financial community, university-industry contracts, trade journals, personal interviews, and company prospectuses."—Sheldon Krimsky, American Scientist "A fine description of a vital new field. It deserves wide readership."—David Silbert and Duncan Newhauser, New England Journal of Medicine "The author raises important questions about whether the character of this university-industrial complex adequately allows for the kind of public discussion and participation necessary to insure consideration of social, economic, and moral issues in the development of this important new technology."—Harvard Educational Review "Bears upon questions of fundamental importance to science, academia, and society and provides valuable documentation of the magnitude of the actions already taken and the multitude of participants involved."—Robert L.

Reflecting an increasing concern for the incoming, housing, and psychological needs of the elderly, the authors suggest how existing programs should be developed. The research study, conducted by the Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, is presented in five sections. The opening section surveys advances made in relocation policy throughout the nation with the advent of large-scale redevelopment as a factor on the urban scene.Chapter 2 describes the elderly population subject to displacement and evaluates the ability of elderly persons to meet the rigors of urban life. In this section major existing programs are described along with their capacity to serve the needs of the relocated elderly. The authors then review four demonstration projects associated with the study. The study closes with a comprehensive statement of recommendations.The book is based, in large part, on several years' research into the relocation of elderly persons, conducted by the Institute for Environmental Studies in cooperation with the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. Directing the study was Chester Rapkin, then Professor of City Planning at the University of Pennsylvania, and assisting him in the capacity of Director of Field Operations was Mary K. Nenno, Associate Director of N.A.H.R.O.Advance reviewers have described the book as "lucid and absorbing" and "of real value to workers and planners in the field."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

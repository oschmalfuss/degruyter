Flugel. Bringing together studies in fashion, body culture and modernism, the book explores the modern fascination with sartorial fashion as well as with clothes as objects, signs, things, and embodied practice.Fashion was deeply implicated with the nineteenth-century modern and remained in focus for the modernities that continued to be proclaimed in the early decades of the following century. Clothing connects with the modernist topoi of the threshold, the trace and the interface; it is the place where character becomes image and where relations between subject and object, organic and inorganic play themselves out in a series of encounters and ruptures. Clothes also facilitate explorations in modern materialism, for instance as informing surrealist attempts to think the materiality of things outside the system of commodities and their fetishisation. Woolf´s work as cultural analyst and writer of fiction provides illuminating illustrations of all of these aspects, "thinking through clothes" in representations of the present, investigations of the archives of the past, and projections for the future.Key FeaturesContributes new research to Woolf and Modernism studiesExplores the significance of textual representations of dress and sartorial fashion in modernist literature Interdisciplinary approach which brings together studies of fashion, culture and literatureAdds a specific author focused analysis to current work on cultural embodiment and performance"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

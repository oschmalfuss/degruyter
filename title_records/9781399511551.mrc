It examines the great expansion of Scottish newspapers, following the removal of the ‘taxes on knowledge’ through to the mid-20th century.W. Hamish Fraser provides the historical basis for meaningful, in-depth study of many different aspects of the Scottish press and adds a new dimension to Scottish historical studies. Through an extensive search of newspapers, the use of local history material and of the limited business and organisational records that are available, he gathers little-known information on the world of Scottish journalism and on the people who provided the mass of the population with their news and tried to shape their attitudes. By focusing on different regions, he moves away from earlier rather sweeping generalisations on a key part of the media in Scotland, and he assesses the extent of continuity and change in a crucial century.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Dubbed the next "frontier" in risk management for financial services, climate related risks are the newest and potentially the most challenging set of risks that banks are encountering. On the one hand, banks must show their commitment to becoming net zero and, on the other, help their customers transition to more sustainable operations, all this while managing climate-related financial risks. It is a paradigm shift from how the banking industry has traditionally managed risks as climate change risks are complex. They are multilayered, multidimensional with uncertain climate pathways that impact real economy which in turn influences the financial ecosystem in myriad ways. Climate Change Risk Management in Banks weaves the complete lifecycle of climate risk management from strategy to disclosures, a must-read for academics, banking professionals and other stakeholders interested in understanding and managing climate change risk. It provides much-needed insights, enabling organizations to respond well to these new risks, protect their businesses, mitigate losses and enhance brand value. Saloni Ramakrishna, an acknowledged financial industry practitioner, argues that given the uncertain and volatile climate paths, complex geopolitical patterns, and sustainability challenges, banks and business professionals will benefit from a wholistic approach to managing climate change risks. The book provides a blueprint and a cohesive framework for embracing and maintaining such an approach, in a simple and structured format.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

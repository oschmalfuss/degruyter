It is the first book to document the sources of finance for film-making, the relations between film producers and financiers, and the wider fiscal and economic landscape of the British film production industry. It covers a period characterised by recurrent crises for the British film industry which also saw profound and far-reaching changes in the provision of film finance, including the establishment of state support mechanisms for British producers (the National Film Finance Corporation and the Eady levy), the shift from producer-finance to distributor-finance, and the growth of American investment in the British production sector. The book explores three interrelated aspects of the history of film finance: the institutional and economic structure of the production sector of the industry; the sources of production finance, including private and public capital and British and foreign investment; and the role of government in providing support for film production. It is an essential reference work for anyone studying the British film industry.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

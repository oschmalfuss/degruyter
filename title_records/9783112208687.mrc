Hailed by his supporters – mainly Muslim nationalists in South Asia – as a great leader, and criticized scathingly by his opponents and dubbed as a ‘toady’ or ‘sycophant’ of the British, Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan remains, hitherto, a very controversial personality. Be that as it may, no one can deny his decisive role in shaping his co-religionists’ destiny in the Indian Sub-continent up to independence, namely the creation of Pakistan. He was, indeed, one of those who took the initiative to save Islam and Muslims from further disgrace and deterioration, at a time when the process of the disintegration of the Muslim world was set in motion and the fate of the Indian Muslims had already begun following a downward trajectory. This book also explores his socio-religious reforms, and particularly his fresh orientation over the issue of Muslim-Christian relationship in the light of modern times, a subject deemed very sensitive in the Indian context at the time.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 01.

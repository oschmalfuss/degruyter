Personal rather than encyclopedic, and informed by Coates's unparalleled access to regular, extensive tastings, this book imparts the author's philosophy and expertise as to how best approach, appreciate, and discuss the wines of Burgundy. Coates updates and supplements the domaine profiles featured in his two previous books, Côte D'Or and The Wines of Burgundy with new in-depth assessments of specific vineyards. Divided into three sections-Vineyard Profiles, Domaine Profiles, and Vintage Assessments-My Favorite Burgundies considers the leading vineyards and today's top estates, and features detailed maps and a wealth of tasting notes that reflect how the wine develops as it ages. Enlivened by Coates's singular, firsthand knowledge and precise descriptions, this is an indispensable guide for amateur and professional enophiles alike.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

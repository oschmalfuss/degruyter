Through the disruptive technology of the era, the issue of language use and how technology affects language has arisen as a critical aspect of human communication. The current ISOL-4 tries to bring the issues of Language and Disruptive Technology to academic discussion. Aims and Scope LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY Language and media, Natural Language Processing, Language and Artificial Intelligence, Corpus Linguistics, Language Education and Technology, Speech and Language Therapy, Language and Cyber Threat, and Related Issues. LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL CHANGE Language and Global Development, Language and Politics, Language and Gender, Language and Conflict, Language and Disaster Management LANGUAGE AND CULTURE Language and Identity, Cross Cultural Communication, Language Preservation RELATED STUDIES Reasearch related to language and technology from various fields Instructions for Authors As an author, it is crucial to follow the guidelines and formatting instructions to prepare and submit your paper in order to have it published in proceedings. Before submitting the paper, please use the conference template which can be found in the the website: isol.fib.unand.ac.id/ Each individual is limited to one personal appearance on the programme as a presenting author. This policy precludes acceptance of papers for more than one presentation. In other words, an author can submit and present only one paper. However, a presenter can always be a non-presenting co-author on additional papers. Please read the instructions carefully prior to submitting: Each paper can only be submitted to ONE track. Submitted papers must NOT have been previously published and if under review, must NOT appear in other conferences. To facilitate the blind review process, remove ALL authors identifying information, including acknowledgements from the text, and document/file properties. (Any submissions with author information will be automatically DELETED; author information and acknowledgements are to be included in a SEPARATE document). The entire paper (title page, abstract, main text, figures, tables, references, etc.) must be in ONE document created in PDF format. The maximum length of the paper is 8 pages (including ALL tables, appendices and references). The paper format should follow the European Management Review Style Guide. Number all of the pages of the paper. Guidelines for Reviewers Reviewing a manuscript written by a fellow scientist is a privilege. However, it is a time-consuming responsibility. Hence, the board, authors, and audiences appreciate your willingness to accept this responsibility and your dedication. ISOL adheres to a double-blind peer-review process that is rapid and fair, and also ensures a high quality of articles published. In so doing, we need reviewers who can provide insightful and helpful comments on submitted manuscripts with a turn around time of about 4 weeks. Maintaining ISOL as a scientific meeting of high quality depends on reviewers with a high level of expertise and an ability to be objective, fair, and insightful in their evaluation of manuscripts. Please consider the following forrevieweng the manuscript: Reviewing manuscript critically, but constructively and preparing detailed comments about the manuscript to help authors improve their work Reviewing multiple versions of a manuscript as necessary Providing all required information within established  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

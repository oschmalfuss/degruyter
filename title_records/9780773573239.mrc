He offers behind-the-scenes views of the fight against Bill 101, campaigning for the No Committee in the 1980 Quebec referendum, and the stand-off at Oka between Mohawks and the provincial police. Paterson also charts his involvement in establishing the McGill University Health Centre and the plans for a new major teaching hospital as well as directing the development and expansion of Bishop's University during his time as president and chancellor.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

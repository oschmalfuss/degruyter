Higher Education in Vietnam reviews the policy context, the history, and the characteristics of higher education in Vietnam and examines the extensive changes that have occurred in recent years until 1993. For the first time, information and statistics are provided about government policies and institutional operations in higher education. Included are four chapters written by ministers as well as two case studies: of the development of a private institution, and of a state university that has revitalized its academic and financial basis. Its twelve chapters were written and edited without invigilation by any government. This volume provides a unique and comprehensive introduction to higher education in Vietnam. It will be of interest both to specialists and to anyone concerned with development in Vietnam and Indochina.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 22.

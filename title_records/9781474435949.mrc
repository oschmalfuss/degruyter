Considering how Shakespeare and his contemporaries understood the ‘North’, it brings together diverse voices to define what the ‘North’ meant and means in relation to Shakespeare. The book also situates Shakespeare’s works alongside less canonical texts and media, as well as detailed case studies of new material from rich but rarely-used local, municipal and performance archives. It provides an opportunity to critically reflect on links and differences between the past and present, England and Scotland, the local and the global.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

But it also raised fundamental questions about the nature and purpose of universities, meritocracy versus inclusivity, and who should wield power over the curriculum, students, and the cultural agenda for society. Patricia Marchak presents a remarkably fair and balanced account of events. In a documentary-style narrative she reports the circumstances and gives a sympathetic reading to the very different perceptions of what happened. The focus is on the wider social and cultural context that gave rise to this painful episode. Racism, Sexism, and the University is not simply about specific events at a particular institution. The issues addressed here are vital to universities everywhere; the political science affair at UBC brings them to the fore in a wide-ranging and hard-hitting debate.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

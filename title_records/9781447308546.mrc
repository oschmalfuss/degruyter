Using current evidence and best practice identified by pilot sites, Delivering personal health budgets contains everything there is to know about the purpose and history of personal health budgets, the evidence for their effectiveness and the challenges they pose to traditional healthcare systems. It describes the essential infrastructure needed for personal health budgets and includes implementation checklists.The book focuses on how personal health budgets can be implemented to achieve the best possible outcomes for individuals, while real life stories from personal health budget holders bring their potential vividly to life. Delivering personal health budgets is essential reading for commissioners, healthcare providers, clinicians and policy makers who are looking for an informative and authoritative guide.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 27.

Transnational Feminism in theUnited States examines how transnational perspectives shape the ways inwhich we create and disseminate knowledge about the world within the UnitedStates, and how the paradigm of transnational feminism is affected by nationalnarratives and public discourses within the country itself.An innovative theoreticalproject that is both deconstructive and constructive, this bookinterrogates the limits of feministthought, primarily through casestudies that illustrate its power to create new fields of research out oftraditionally interdisciplinary lines of inquiry. Leela Fernandes discussesways to approach, analyze, and capture processes that exceed and unsettle thenation-state within the transnational feminist paradigm. Examining the linksbetween power and knowledge that bind interdisciplinary theory and research, she shines new light on issues suchas human rights as well as academic debates about transnational feministperspectives on global issues. A thought-provoking analysis, Transnational Feminism in the United States powerfullycontributes to the field of Women'sStudies and related cross-disciplinary scholarship on feminist theory andgender from a global perspective.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 08.

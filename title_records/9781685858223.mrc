But are these changes in fact resulting in economic gains for women? And will this produce an intensification or a subversion of the patriarchal gender contract that has thus far characterized the region? Addressing these questions, this book examines the connections between gender relations and economic reform. Moghadam begins with an overview of the political economy of women’s employment and education, followed by case studies from Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and Turkey. In the final chapters of the book, she draws together data to explore future possibilities for gender relations in the MENA states.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

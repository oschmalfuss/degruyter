National Security and Immigration identifies the security-related implications and determinants of immigration and border policies in the United States and Western Europe since 1945. The author shows how international migration presents the state with important choices that impact economic production and the accumulation of wealth, manpower resources, internal security, relations with other states, and national identity—the very fabric of our sense of social belonging. In contrast to the argument that policy is largely the product of domestic interest groups, this book reveals how immigration and border policies are shaped by the state's desire to maximize national security interests along three primary dimensions—defense, wealth, and stability.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

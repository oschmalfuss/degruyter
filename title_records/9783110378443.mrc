A common point of view on numerous classes of problems that were traditionally studied independently of each other enables us to study, in a natural way, the theory of these problems, to supplement and improve the existing results, and in certain cases, study some of these problems for the first time.With the help of the technique of generalized inverse operators, the Vishik– Lyusternik method, and iterative methods, we perform a detailed investigation of the problems of existence, bifurcations, and branching of the solutions of linear and nonlinear boundary-value problems for various classes of differential-operator systems and propose new procedures for their construction.For more than 11 years that have passed since the appearance of the first edition of the monograph, numerous new publications of the authors in this direction have appeared. In this connection, it became necessary to make some additions and corrections to the previous extensively cited edition, which is still of signifi cant interest for the researchers.For researchers, teachers, post-graduate students, and students of physical and mathematical departments of universities.

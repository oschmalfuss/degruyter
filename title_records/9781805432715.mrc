A Bohemian version of her Vita was written in the second half of the fourteenth century, probably for the court of Emperor Charles IV in Prague; it is a fascinating account of her life and passion, with many unique features. However, partly because of the language barrier, it has received relatively little attention.This book provides the first complete translation of this important text. It is accompanied by a full, interdisciplinary introduction, which places the legend in its cultural and historical context, and emphasizes both the importance of the Dominican friars as court writers and the prominence of royal and noble women as patrons and consumers of their work. It also highlights the numerous representations of Catherine in contemporary art. Meanwhile, elucidatory notes to the translation illuminate its most important features.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

These were crucial decades during which economic thinkers re-examined how they conceptualised and depicted commerce as a system. Adapting approaches pioneered by scholars working under the expansive rubric of Science Studies, Performing Economic Thought compares the formal features of treatises and plays, giving particular attention to those features unique to the theatrical experience (for example, the presence of props and actors' bodies and the position of the audience relative to the staged action) that allowed economic systems to be represented and conceptualised differently in the playhouse than in the printed treatise. The book argues that the representational techniques available to playwrights facilitated a more insightful exploration of economic systems than those available to economic writers.Key Features:Reevaluates the pseudo-literary features of mercantile treatises in light of recent work in Science Studies and rhetoric of economicsAnalyzes specific ways that early modern plays could produce knowledgeOutlines a dramaturgy that allows readers to appreciate non-canonical plays and reevaluate canonical ones.Provides an account of the relationship between economic thought and drama that offers a historical perspective to modern debates about the fictionality and performativity of economic discourse"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

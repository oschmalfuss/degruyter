Statistics that lack credibility are of little value. Those that can be defended against critics can be effective in throwing the light on violations and promoting the observance of human rights for all. The contributors to this book, including experts in political science, public health, law, forensic pathology, and statistics, illustrate good statistical practice in the field of human rights and show the importance of collaboration between statisticians and other professionals. The treatment is largely nonmathematical, and the examples provide broad coverage of all features of the collection and use of statistical data on human rights violations. For readers who would like to do their own analyses, an extensive guide to human rights data sources is included. This book is the first to describe and summarize important issues associated with the collection and uses of human rights statistics.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 23.

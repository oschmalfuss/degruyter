In Ocean to Plate: Cooking Fish with Hawai‘i’s Kusuma Cooray, Chef Cooray draws on her years as a chef and culinary instructor to introduce novice and experienced cooks to her flavorful methods of fish preparation. Even skilled cooks are sometimes intimidated by the thought of preparing fresh fish recipes. From understanding how to buy the freshest and tastiest fish to choosing the right recipe to showcase your purchase, Chef Cooray takes the reader carefully through the rewarding process – all the way from Ocean to Plate. With more than 200 recipes including everything from appetizers to main dishes, and featuring cooking methods from simple baking to curing and smoking, Chef Cooray shows readers how to prepare the many species available freshly caught from Hawai‘i and Pacific waters, and provides substitution guidelines if those are unobtainable. As a special treat, she has drawn on her Sri Lankan roots and presents a varied assortment of fish curries and exotically spiced preparations alongside more traditional recipes, all accompanied by tantalizing relishes, chutneys, and sauces. In-depth introductory chapters will help cooks to truly understand tools and techniques, while lavish illustrations provide beautiful guidance on how to present these delicious dishes.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 17.

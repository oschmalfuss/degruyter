He hailed from a distinguished American family with a record of public service that began in the Washington administration. The experience of World War II-when Lodge became the first sitting senator since the 1860s to resign his seat for military service-dramatically transformed him from isolationist to internationalist, and the Cold War tested his faith in democracy and its ability to project its system of values abroad. Lodge was among the last of his kind: the well-heeled Eastern Establishment Republicans who put duty over partisanship and saw themselves as the hereditary captains of the American state. Using previously unexamined material, historian Luke A. Nichter recounts, for the first time, Lodge's extraordinary and consequential life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

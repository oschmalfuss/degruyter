It is also one of its most controversial and misunderstood traditions among both Muslims and non-Muslims. In an environment of increasing conservatism in both Euro-American and Muslim-majority societies, in a world where a woman’s right to wear the headscarf has become a touchstone for issues of all sorts, and at a time when racial and religious profiling has become commonplace, it is our political and social responsibility to gain a deeper understanding of veiling.This concise, easy-to-read and even-handed introduction is organised around three main topics: the historical, religious and cultural background; contemporary debates about the veil; and the varied, shifting meanings the veil has had for Muslim women over the past century.Key Features:Explains the role of veiling in the religious, cultural, political and social lives of Muslims past and presentLooks at the meaning and practice of veiling in Europe, the Middle East and the USAGives a wider perspective on the veil, leading to a more nuanced understanding of Muslim women and Islam in generalPresents the necessary background to more informed discussions over national and foreign policy"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

His last Cabinet post was as health minister during the London blitz, where he worked with Winston Churchill. Sent to Canada as British high commissioner, MacDonald became Mackenzie King's confidant during the conscription crisis, the Gouzenko spy revelations, and the American "occupation" during the building of the Alaska Highway. His greatest work was done during his fourteen years in Asia, most notably in preparing Malaya's different racial groups for independence and mending fences between India and Britain after the Suez invasion of 1956. MacDonald's skill as a negotiator came from a combination of hard work, patience, and a great sense of fun and humanity. Walking on his hands around Nehru, swapping bird-watching tales with de Valera, discussing Chinese ceramics with Marshal Chen Yi, or playing nursery games with Jomo Kenyatta and the Iban head-hunter family who adopted him, he charmed his way to a remarkable series of diplomatic successes.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

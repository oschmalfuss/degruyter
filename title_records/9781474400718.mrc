How can liberal states develop institutions of democratic citizenship and at the same time justifiably exclude 'outsiders' from participating in those institutions? The book examines various responses to this contradiction within the liberal tradition, and finds none of them satisfactory - there are no consistently liberal justifications for immigration control and this has serious implications both for liberal practice and theory.Key FeaturesAn original contribution to political philosophy - fills a significant gap in the marketA comprehensive review and critique of theoretical arguments within political philosophy which attempt to justify practices of exclusionAn outline of a radical position on that questionA review of immigration and naturalisation practices of liberal democratic states including the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia and New ZealandApplies theoretical perspectives to the practices of immigration and naturalisation  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

How do policy advocates engage in advocacy activities to exercise influence? Building on existing theories of state, society, and public policies in democracies, Advocacy and Policymaking in South Korea argues that the legacy of state-society relationships explains who influences and how in South Korean policymaking. The state-society relationship has been a popular framework to explain democratic transition and consolidation. Yet, few studies to date extend the approach to explain advocacy and policymaking across political systems. Jiso Yoon shows the relevance of the framework in explaining advocacy and policymaking today with empirical evidence drawn from the contemporary policy process in South Korea. In addition, she compares policy communities across new and old democracies, such as South Korea and the United States. In this regard, the comparative analysis included in the book sets an important research example for students of comparative public policy to follow.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

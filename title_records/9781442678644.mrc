Comparing across two generations of Portuguese Canadian women, the book delves into issues such as cultural heterogeneity among Portuguese immigrants, the ambiguity of work and gender politics, the concept of 'home' versus nationalism, and raises concerns about the ways in which global political and economic inequities have affected Portuguese women's citizenship.Drawing on over sixty interviews with Portuguese immigrants and community workers in Toronto, Giles weaves theoretical perspectives around direct "es to provide a complete picture of the Portuguese immigrant experience. Her case study of Portuguese women sheds new light not only on Portuguese immigrants to Canada, but also on Canadian nationalism, immigration, and multicultural policies, and their connection with national and global economic situations, that affect all immigrants to Canada.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

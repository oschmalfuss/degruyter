His medical career spans decades of change as modern technology made possible more complex treatment situations. His observations on his own distinguished career in medicine from his perspective as a bioethicist are instructive and informative.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Identifying and directing attention to the most significant aspects of these fields and pointing out profitable lines for additional inquiry, it is written in terms broad enough to challenge anyone interested in life and culture in the United States, whether or not he is enrolled in a formal academic program.This second volume covers the history and social sciences of the United States. The outline leads the student into such areas as this country's natural resources, its birth as a nation, the west­ward movement, the Civil War, and the rise to world power. Business, government and politics, religion, technology, agriculture, education, the character and values of the American nation, and many other related topics are delineated.The syllabus is based directly on the books required for reading for the University of Pennsylvania examination for the Certificate in American Studies. But it does not attempt to parallel or condense the American Civilization curriculum of the University. Instead, the syllabus is intended to have broad usefulness and to serve both as a basic guide for formal instruction at foreign universities or other educational institutions and also as a guide to the reader engaged in individual study.Each section of the syllabus follows closely the arrangement of the required readings and is divided into five parts:Required Readings identifies the books from the reading lists that pertain to each topic.Major Topics provides an outline to show the important factors and subfactors of each topic that will aid the student to understand the topic and broaden his comprehension of the required readings.Discussion Problems presents problems of the kind that demand a sustained probing beneath their surface aspects, and thus require considerable effort before full understanding can be achieved.Study Exercises varies in form from one topic to another, because it is designed to fit the contents of each topic and to stimulate understanding and expression.Additional Readings supplements the lists of required books to show sources for additional information.The syllabus does not in any way take the place of the books themselves. But it does provide a topical organization that will guide and stimulate inquiry, arouse curiosity, and point out important interrelationships. It will be a good companion for anyone engaged in the absorbing study of American civilization.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

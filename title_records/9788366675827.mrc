Accessuhttps://purl.org/coar/access_right/c_abf2funrestricted online access2star  a1st WoW-SAIPIS 2021 is an article writing workshop centered on social sciences and education, open and welcoming contributions from various disciplines and approaches that meet at intersections. We are interested in scholarship that crosses disciplinary lines and speaks to readers from a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives. In other words, 1st WoW-SAIPIS 2021 will be a forum for scholars as they speak to a wider audience of our many sub-fields and specialties, rather than a location for narrower conversations that are more appropriate in more specialized conferences. We suggest the following broad areas of research: Social Sciences and Laws History and Cultural Studies Interdisciplinary Studies Moral and Humanities Policy, Politics, and Communication Education The proceedings represent the latest in research, development, deployment and projects on a range of topics presented at the International Conference of Social Science and Education. The papers published under each conference are sorted according to the themes and topics defined under each event. Papers are published according to the events at which they were presented by the authors. They can be searched by theme, author, or title. All the papers published here are open access, thus free of charge. Complete versions of the conference proceedings are also available as PDF to download. Editorial Policy All articles submitted to WOW-SAIPIS will generally be reviewed by two experts who will be asked to evaluate whether the manuscript is scientifically sound and coherent, whether it duplicates already published works, and whether or not the manuscript is sufficiently clear for publication. Review reports Reviewers are asked to evaluate whether the manuscript: • Is original by stating the objectives and gap clearly • Is methodologically sound • Follows appropriate ethical guidelines • Has results/findings which are clearly presented and support the conclusions • Correctly references previous relevant work • Reviewers are not expected to correct or copyedit manuscripts. Language correction is not part of the peer review process. Decision Reviewers advise the editor of WOW-SAIPIS, who is responsible for the final decision to accept, reject, or request revisions of referred papers based on the reviews and editorial insight of the supporting parties. In addition, Editors will have the option of seeking additional reviews when needed. Authors will be advised when Editors decide further review is needed. Guidelines for Reviewers All submitted manuscripts are read by the editorial staff. The review process uses a double blind review system. Those manuscripts evaluated by editors to be inappropriate regarding the criteria are rejected promptly without external review. Manuscripts evaluated to be of potential interest to our readership are sent to reviewers. The editors then decide based on the reviewer's recommendation from among several possibilities: rejected, require major revision, need minor revision, or accepted. Ethical Guideline for Publication The publication of an article in proceeding (Sciendo) is an essential building block in the development of a coherent and respected network of knowledge. It is a direct reflection of the quality of the work of the authors and the institutions that support them. Peer-reviewed articles support and embody the scientific methods. It is therefore important to agree upon the standards of expected ethical behavior for all parties involved in the act of publishing: the author, the editor, the reviewer, the publisher  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aThis eBook is made available Open Access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license: uhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 uhttps://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/open-access-policy  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

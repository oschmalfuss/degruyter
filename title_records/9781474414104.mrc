The coverage, from classical through to renaissance literature, gives a sense of how the revenge motifs appear over timeIt will appeal to a wide readership including those working in classics, medieval and renaissance literature, gender studies, revenge and revenge tragedy and the intertextual relations between ancient, medieval and early modern textsIt considers what constitutes the literary revenge tragedy tradition, suggesting points of continuity and difference as well as rethinking the parameters of the genreContributorsAlessandra Abbattista wrote her PhD on animal metaphors and the depiction of female avengers in Attic tragedy at the University of Roehampton.

As Kagan unwinds his own history, he reveals the seminal events that have shaped his career and discusses how his assumptions have changed. With full appreciation for the contributions to psychology of history, philosophy, literature, and neuroscience, he approaches a wide range of fascinating topics, including:· the abandonment of orthodox forms of behaviorism and psychoanalysis· the forces that inspired later-twentieth-century curiosity about young children· why B. F. Skinner chose to study psychology· why the study of science less often ignites imaginations today· our society's obsession with erotic love· the resurgence of religious fanaticism and the religious RightEmbedded in Kagan's discussions is a rejection of the current notion that a mature neuroscience will eventually replace psychology. He argues that a complete understanding of brain is not synonymous with a full explanation of mind, and he concludes with a brief prediction of the next five decades in the field of psychology.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

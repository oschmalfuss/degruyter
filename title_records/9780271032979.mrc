For both, appeal to grounding is problematic, but the presumed groundedness of particular judgments remains an unavoidable feature of discourse and, as such, in need of understanding. For feminist theory, Wittgenstein suggests responses to the immobilizing tugs between modernist modes of theorizing and postmodern challenges to them. For Wittgenstein, feminist theory suggests responses to those who would turn him into the ";normal"; philosopher he dreaded becoming, one who offers perhaps unorthodox solutions to recognizable philosophical problems. In addition to an introductory essay by Naomi Scheman, the volume's twenty chapters are grouped in sections titled ";The Subject of Philosophy and the Philosophical Subject,"; ";Wittgensteinian Feminist Philosophy: Contrasting Visions,"; ";Drawing Boundaries: Categories and Kinds,"; ";Being Human: Agents and Subjects,"; and ";Feminism's Allies: New Players, New Games."; These essays give us ways of understanding Wittgenstein and feminist theory that make the alliance a mutually fruitful one, even as they bring to their readings of Wittgenstein an explicitly historical and political perspective that is, at best, implicit in his work. The recent salutary turn in (analytic) philosophy toward taking history seriously has shown how the apparently timeless problems of supposedly generic subjects arose out of historically specific circumstances. These essays shed light on the task of feminist theorists-along with postcolonial, queer, and critical race theorists-to (in Wittgenstein's words) ";rotate the axis of our examination"; around whatever ";real need[s]"; might emerge through the struggles of modernity's Others.

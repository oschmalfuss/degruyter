For example, prior domestic strife can be linked to the escalation of foreign conflict in an impressive number of cases, a discovery which runs counter to the consensus which has emerged over the last two decades among political scientists. Prior research on causes of war has often lacked rigour. James has tried to remedy this through a long-term, comparative approach to the subject matter. While Crisis and War follows the tradition of aggregate research, statistical analysis is always connected to particular events through discussions of situations and leaders in both diplomatic history and contemporary world politics. James' comprehensive and original approach to past theories both clarifies and critiques them.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

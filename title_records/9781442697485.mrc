Governing the Energy Challenge is a comparative study between Canada and Germany that features essays by leading energy and public policy specialists from both countries. It identifies numerous strategies to produce more efficient and sustainable energy by revealing the ways in which Germany, as a member of the European Union, is more advanced in dealing with multi-level governmental tensions and sustainability constraints than Canada has as a member of NAFTAPaying particular attention to the relationship between environmental study, climate change issues, and economic market reforms, this volume analyses the influence that the energy sector and multi-level institutional arrangements have on energy governance. The contributors provide valuable information on the formation of energy policy, offering insights into the growing differences between countries who are members of NAFTA and the European Union.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

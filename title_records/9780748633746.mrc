This book offers a unique analysis of letter-writing, focusing on the notion of the power of the pen. The author looks at the wider context of epistolography, relating it to the power structures of Islamic society in that period. He also attempts to identify some of the similarities and differences between Muslim modes of letter-writing and those of western cultures.One of the strengths of this book is that it is based on a wide range of primary Arabic sources, thus reflecting the broader epistemological importance of letter-writing in Islamic society.Key FeaturesEvaluates the background to letter-writing as the principal representation of state documents and communicationTakes a close look at the literary principles employed in that processConsiders the important social and intellectual role of the secretary and how he fitted into the power structure of Islamic society during this periodArgues that the voluminous collections of letters, written mainly in artistic prose, can be classified as an epistolary genre in their own rightShows that Islamic letter-writing was very culture-specific  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

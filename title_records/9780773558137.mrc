Once deemed taboo, uncharitable conduct towards those in need has become increasingly acceptable, and even desirable, throughout the Western world. From Righteousness to Far Right follows nineteen months of ethnographic fieldwork with a grassroots NGO in a small Swedish village, where over one hundred refugees were housed. Through an embedded, anthropological study of day-to-day life in refugee resettlement, Emma Mc Cluskey examines how increasingly antagonistic and xenophobic policies concerning refugees gained legitimacy. Arguing that existing approaches to critical security studies inadequately address the textured, contradictory, and often resistant practices of everyday life within societies, Mc Cluskey re-gears securitization theory along anthropological lines and shifts the focus of the investigation onto the "idian realm, where much of the controversy over migration and security plays out. A provocative and original political statement on today's increasingly conservative society, From Righteousness to Far Right presents an astounding new perspective on the recent refugee crises and the acceptance and normalization of far-right and securitarian politics.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

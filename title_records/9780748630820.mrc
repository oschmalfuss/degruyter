A journey through these turbulent times observes the response of Scottish artisans to legal restrictions on trade-union activities in the 1870s, trade union formation among the unskilled from the late 1880s, and the origins and impact of the Scottish socialist movement.The Labour movement in Scotland was to face many new challenges by the twentieth century. During the era of 'Red Scotland', 1910 to 1922, we see Scottish workers fully engaged in the labour and social unrest in the years before the Great War; monitor the incubation of workers' grievances during the war; see the growth of the anti-war movement and the influence of revolutionary politics from 1918; and witness Scottish Labour on the threshold of an extraordinary political breakthrough by 1922. The 1920s saw the rapid rise of Labour, but growing unemployment and a massive emigration of Scottish workers helped to fragment the left and set in motion the decline of left radicalism in Scotland. This book represents a major and up to date survey of the most dramatic years in the history of Scottish Labour.Key FeaturesProvides comprehensive coverage of the period introducing new research sources and plugging gaps in current literature with case studiesCase studies provide detailed examination of important topics; 'new unionism'; strike and political action; quantitative method, 1910-14; new archive sources on 'revolutionary politics'Provides case studies and regional comparative studies approach towards a better understanding of the main themes in the history of Scottish LabourTwo chapters look at the themes and issues concerned with writing Labour history  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

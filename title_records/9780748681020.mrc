Does the attempt to uncover how such texts might have been received by their original readers and audiences uncover new, hitherto unexpected contemporary resonances in them? Or does it flatten works of art into mere ‘secondary sources’ for historical analysis? This book makes the case for the study of literature in context. It demonstrates the value of historical and cultural analysis alongside traditional literary scholarship for enriching our understanding of plays and poems from the medieval and early Tudor past and of the cultures which produced and received them. It equally accepts the risks involved in that kind of study.Key FeaturesMakes the case for reading medieval and early Tudor literature historicallyCase studies of the interaction between literature and politics, from Chaucer to the reign of Henry VIIIDetailed analysis of key medieval and Renaissance texts, Chaucer’s Miller’s Tale, Sir Gawain and Green Knight, Sir David Lyndsay’s A Satire of the Three EstatesTurns a spotlight on hitherto neglected texts that reveal the challenges, rewards and potential pitfalls of reading literature historically  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

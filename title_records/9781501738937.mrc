She argues that reciprocity—targeted retaliation against noncooperative actions by trading partners and specific rewards for cooperation—is a relatively effective way of establishing and maintaining an open international trading regime.In re-assessing American trade policy, Rhodes maintains that policy failures before 1934 were more the result of illiberalism than of strict reciprocity and that the Roosevelt administrations retained the principle of reciprocity in order to pre serve fair trade. She shows that the practice of reciprocity was enshrined in the postwar General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade even though it can violate the norm of non-discrimination and, further, that reciprocity has proved essential to effective trade bargaining under the aegis of the GATT. In detailed accounts of the management of international trade in steel, automobiles, and wheat flour, she evaluates the effectiveness of reciprocity as a principle on which to base trade policy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

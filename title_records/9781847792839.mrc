Unlike virtually all other studies of Gibraltar, this book focuses on the civilian population. It shows how a substantial multi-ethnic Roman Catholic and Jewish population derived mainly from the littorals and islands of the Mediterranean became settled in British Gibraltar, much of it in defiance of British efforts to control entry and restrict residence. With Gibraltar’s political future still today contested this is a matter of considerable political importance. Community and identity: The making of modern Gibraltar since 1704 will appeal to both a scholarly and a lay readership interested particularly in the ‘Rock’ or more generally in nationality and identity formation, colonial administration, decolonisation and the Iberian peninsula.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

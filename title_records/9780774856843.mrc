These widely scattered areas were all visited by warships of the Russian navy and by companies of highly educated and observant officers and "gentlemen of science" in the early 1800's. Barratt's annotated and careful translations of the visitors' eyewitness accounts provide fascinating, sometimes amusing, reading about the landfalls of the ships. The Russians' journals, reports, and drawings are collated with artefacts collected on the spot and with contemporaneous European data to produce a vivid picture of life and culture in these parts of the South Pacific in the early post-contact period. Although available in Soviet archives, many of the primary sources that Barratt has examined for this book have until now been almost completely ignored by Western scholars in spite of their importance in understanding the changes that took place in post-contact Oceania. These archival holdings, as described by the author, will be of major importance to those interested in the history and ethnohistory of southern and eastern Polynesia.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

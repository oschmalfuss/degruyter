James Morone argues that Americans will never solve their collective problems as long as they instinctively fear all public power as a threat to liberty. This revised edition includes a new final chapter about contemporary populism, government bashing, and democratic wishes. Winner of the 1991 Gladys M. Kammerer Award "The Democratic Wish merits the highest compliments one can accord a public policy book. It spotlights a problem that can no longer be evaded. And it makes you think."-Alan Tonelson, New York Times Book Review "Morone writes with flair and passion. The fact that he puts forth a provocative argument and provides concise histories of labor, civil rights, and health care politics makes this book especially useful for teaching American politics."-R. Shep Melnick, Journal of Interdisciplinary History "Morone's contribution to our understanding of state building . . . is substantial and profound."-John S. Dryzek, American Political Science Review "This stimulating reinterpretation of American political history will interest both scholars concerned about the past and citizens concerned about the future."-Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. "This is a persuasive, illuminating study in American political ideas and the disappointments of reform."-Dean McSweeney, American Politics Review   aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

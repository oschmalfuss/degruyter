How it was rewarded is the subject of these studies, ranging over time, region, and occupation. Topics discussed here include children under the parish apprenticeship system, women's work for poor law authorities and how it was taken into account by welfare systems, the changing nature of women's work, remuneration and technology in British agriculture, questionsof customary norms governing pay, female employment in many hitherto neglected urban industries, and women and the East India Company. The issues of gendered wages and customary earnings, family economies, regional and rural-urbancontrasts, the impact of technological change, and the links between female work and formal welfare systems, are raised throughout.

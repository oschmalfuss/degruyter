The book focuses on the key social policy issues of employment, health and mental health, housing, family and low income and poverty. It shows how understanding and treating these as issues interconnected to criminal justice outcomes can and does lead to improvements in criminal justice practice. This book enables students and criminal justice practitioners to understand how social policy concepts can better inform practice with those involved in the criminal justice system. It features: • chapter aims; • key learning boxes; • questions to support independent learning; • further reading; • a glossary of terms.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

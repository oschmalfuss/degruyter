He is the screenwriter of such beloved blockbusters as The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Bodyguard (1992), and The Force Awakens (2015). Simultaneously, he has gained critical acclaim as the director of pictures that dissect contemporary American society: Body Heat (1981), The Big Chill (1983), The Accidental Tourist (1988), and Grand Canyon (1991).Frequently experimenting in different genres, Kasdan’s filmography defies easy classification, and this book is the very first global analysis of his career. Taking an inclusive, interdisciplinary approach in order to examine all aspects of his eclectic canon, the investigation reveals Lawrence Kasdan as a filmmaker who has helped shape modern American cinema, both through his screenplays for popular classics, and as writer-director of films synonymous with the largest demographic in US history.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

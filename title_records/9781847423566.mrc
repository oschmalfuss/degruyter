However, the increasing emphasis on multi-disciplinary and inter-agency working required for effective, joined-up services presents new challenges and dilemmas in preserving citizens' rights to privacy. This book examines key philosophical, ethical and legal issues in the area of privacy and confidentiality and explores their implications for policy and practice. ,Offering a range of analytical frameworks the book focuses on different practice areas, including health and social care, children's services and criminal justice. The contributors from disciplines including law, philosophy, anthropology and the personal service professions bring their direct personal experience of working to create new systems and practices in a turbulent policy environment. The book provides a synoptic multi-disciplinary view of this increasingly challenging area where technological development, civil liberties, surveillance, health and welfare become inexorably intertwined. The book will be of key interest to professionals, managers, policy makers and academics in the health and personal social services. Students of social work, probation, medicine, nursing and professions allied to medicine will find a common multidisciplinary framework for their respective professional concerns to protect the interests and promote the wellbeing of clients, their families and the wider community.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

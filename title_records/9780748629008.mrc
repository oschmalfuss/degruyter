For that, he has occupied a central place in the political imagination of Europe ever since. Yet he remains something of an enigma, struck down by his own lieutenants because he could be neither comprehended nor contained. In surviving evidence he emerges as incommensurate and nonpareil, just beyond the horizons of contemporary political thought and understanding.The result of Luciano Canfora’s many years of research is a fascinating portrait of the Roman dictator, combining the evidence of political history and psychology. The product of a comprehensive study of the ancient sources, it paints an astonishingly detailed portrait of a complex personality whose mission of ‘Romanisation’ lies at the root of modern Europe.Key Features*Easy, engaging and pleasurable to read*About 42 chronological studies of events create a full portrait of Caesar and the contemporary Roman background*Space is devoted to the details surrounding his assassination  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

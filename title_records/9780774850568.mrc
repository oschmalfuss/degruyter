While many studies have focused on women who seek to protect the natural environment, few have explored the perspectives of women who seek to maintain resource use. This book goes beyond the dichotomies of "pro" and "anti" environmentalism to tell the stories of these women. Maureen Reed uses participatory action research to explain the experiences of women who seek to protect forestry as an industry, a livelihood, a community, and a culture. She links their experiences to policy making by considering the effects of environmental policy changes on the social dynamics of workplaces, households, and communities in forestry towns of British Columbia's temperate rainforest. The result is a critical commentary about the social dimensions of sustainability in rural communities. A powerful and challenging book, Taking Stands provides a crucial understanding of community change in resource-dependent regions, and helps us to better tackle the complexities of gender and activism as they relate to rural sustainability. Social and environmental geographers, feminist scholars, and those engaged in rural studies, environmental sustainability, community planning, and policy making will find it invaluable.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Ten grown victims, who as children suffered banishment, starvation, disease, anti-Semitism, and trauma resulting from their parents’ condemnation and arrest, now freely share their stories.  The result is a powerful and moving oral history that will profoundly deepen the reader’s understanding of life in the U.S.S.R. under the despotic reign of Joseph Stalin.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

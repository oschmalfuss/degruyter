Before submitting the paper, please use the conference template which can be found in the the website: pahmi13.conference.unand.ac.id/ Each individual is limited to one personal appearance on the programme as a presenting author. This policy precludes acceptance of papers for more than one presentation. In other words, an author can submit and present only one paper. However, a presenter can always be a non-presenting co-author on additional papers. Please read the instructions carefully prior to submitting: Each paper can only be submitted to ONE track. Submitted papers must NOT have been previously published and if under review, must NOT appear in other conferences. To facilitate the blind review process, remove ALL authors identifying information, including acknowledgements from the text, and document/file properties.

The entire paper (title page, abstract, main text, figures, tables, references, etc.) must be in ONE document created in PDF format. The maximum length of the paper is 8 pages (including ALL tables, appendices and references). The paper format should follow the European Management Review Style Guide.

In so doing, we need reviewers who can provide insightful and helpful comments on submitted manuscripts with a turn around time of about 4 weeks. Maintaining PAHMI as a scientific meeting of high quality depends on reviewers with a high level of expertise and an ability to be objective, fair, and insightful in their evaluation of manuscripts.

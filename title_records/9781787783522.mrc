ITIL 4 DSV provides essential knowledge and capabilities for service management professionals, focusing on the engagements between a service provider and its customers, users, suppliers and partners, and how demand is converted into value via IT-enabled services. DSV is one of the ITIL 4 advanced level modules that leads to the MP (Managing Professional) certification. The module is aimed at managers and aspiring managers at all levels, providing them with the practical skills to build effective relationships across the SVS. An excellent supplement to any ITIL 4 DSV training course The majority of this book is based on the official AXELOS ITIL® 4: Drive Stakeholder Value publication and the associated Drive Stakeholder Value Managing Professional syllabus. It provides students with the information they need to pass the DSV exam, and help them become a successful practitioner. This book is suitable for ITIL v3 Experts, ITIL 4 MP students, ITSM (IT service management) practitioners who are adopting ITIL 4, approved training organisations, IT service managers, IT managers and those in IT support roles. The guide focuses on: The customer journey; Fostering stakeholder relationships; How to: shape demand and define service offerings, and align expectations and agree service details; Onboarding and offboarding; Continual value co-creation; Realising and validating service value; and Exam preparation. A useful tool throughout your career In addition to being an essential study aid, the author — a seasoned ITSM professional — also provides additional guidance throughout the book, which you can lean on once your training and exam are over. The book includes her own practical experience, from which she gives advice, and points to think about along the way, so that you can refer back to this book for years to come – long after you’ve passed your exam.

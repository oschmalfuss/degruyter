This concise book, the only up-to-date history of Berkeley, is a rich chronicle connecting the people, trends, and events that made the city to much larger themes in history. From the native builders of shellmounds to the blue-collar residents of Ocean View, the rise of the University of California, the World War II shipyards, and today's demographics and politics, it's all here in this fascinating account of the other beloved city by the bay. Along the way, we find the answers to many intriguing questions: Why is Adeline Street is so oddly aligned? How did Berkeley benefit from the 1906 earthquake that destroyed much of San Francisco? What differentiated Holy Hill from Nut Hill? Berkeley: A City in History offers a delightful sense of place to anyone who has lived in, worked in, or traveled through this unique city.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

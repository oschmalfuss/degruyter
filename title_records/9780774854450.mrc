Genetic differences among and within populations of these trees become important considerations when forests are regenerated artificially by seeding and planting, and when new species are introduced in forestry, agroforestry, or for ornamental and landscape purposes. Geographic Variation in Forest Trees is the first book to examine this subject from a world-wide perspective. Following a historical review, the author discusses population genetic theory and genetic systems of native North American tree species as they interact with environments in the major climatic regions in the world. He then demonstrates how this knowledge is used to guide seed zoning and seed transfer in silviculture, basing much of his discussion on models developed in Scandinavia and North America. In the final chapter, the author addresses the issue of genetic conservation -- a subject of great concern in the face of accelerated forest destruction, industrial pollution, and climatic change. This comprehensive, well-researched book makes a significant contribution to the knowledge of one of our most important renewable natural resources.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Written by a journalist who witnessed the Balkan conflagration and its aftermath, it presents a gripping analysis of the origins of the Serb-Albanian conflict, the course of the battle, the involvement of the Western powers, the issues and the personalities, and the options for the future.Tim Judah sets the conflict in its full historical context. He explains how Kosovo became the crucible of a poisonous ethnic struggle between Serbs and Albanians that led to the destruction of the old Yugoslavia. He analyzes the character and career of Slobodan Milosevic and tells how Kosovo provided the springboard for him to mobilize the Serbs and seize supreme power. He reveals details of the lost opportunity of the February 1999 Rambouillet conference for peace and compromise in the southern Balkans. He describes how exiled Kosovar militants could take their war from Swiss cafés to the mountains of northern Albania. And he examines how and why NATO launched its first-ever war—a 78-day campaign of high-tech air strikes against Serbia—believing the onslaught would be over in days.Based on extensive research, eyewitness reports, and interviews with leading protagonists, Judah’s book is compelling—and compulsory—reading.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

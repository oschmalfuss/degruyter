Combining the Victorian virtues of communication, cooperation, and competition, it promised to advertise the choice products of civilization to a receptive public. The Inglorious Arts of Peace is the first comprehensive look at the history of these cultural extravaganzas in Canada.Early in the nineteenth century, provincial governments began to sponsor exhibitions that advertised highly bred livestock and modern techniques of rotation and manuring to farmers. Hundreds of agricultural and industrial exhibitions sprang up across central Canada until, by the end of the century, exhibiting was an enormous industry attracting a mass audience. Heaman examines the ways in which British North America was advertised at home and abroad in the pursuit of productivity, markets, capital, and immigrants, and evaluates the exhibitions' impact on private industry, the government, and Canadian identity. She also considers the participation of women and native peoples at local and international exhibits, showing how they transcended the limited spheres of representation imposed upon them. The Inglorious Arts of Peace will appeal to those interested in Canadian history and in the historical constructions of gender and race.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

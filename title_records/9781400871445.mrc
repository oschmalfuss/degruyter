Refining the theory advanced in his earlier study of China and Japan, Gilbert Rozman examines the development of Russia over several centuries with emphasis on the period immediately preceding the Industrial Revolution. He makes possible comparison of urbanization in five countries (including England and France as well as Russia) and develops a systematic framework for analyzing cities of varying size. Treatment of Russia includes a history of urban development prior to 1750, an examination of late eighteenth-century social structure as it related to cities, and a study of regional variations in urbanization. The author presents a wealth of information until now unavailable in English. Since this information is provided in a format similar to that used in the earlier book, data on Russia can readily be placed in broad perspective. Comparisons with the other countries show that Russia's development was less slow than has been supposed. Separate sections on England and France supply estimates of the number of settlements at each level of their urban hierarchies.Originally published in 1976.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

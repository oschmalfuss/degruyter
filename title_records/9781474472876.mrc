There were also various private press adventures in poetry with his stepson Lloyd Osbourne, and the posthumous Songs of Travel (1895), and New Poems (1918).

Complete and accurate dates of composition and publication of individual poems and of collections are given wherever possible.Appendices include bibliographical description and location for manuscript and printed sources of all poems in the edition; 'poems in process' – how Stevenson sketched and revised during composition; notebooks – bibliographical history and significance; chronology and ordonnance of poetic units. There are also explanatory and textual notes.

Their increasing importance is deriving from their mission, structure and capabilities to obtain and promote different interests in the economy and wider society. It is important to understand their mission, vision and activities and ideally to include Banking Associations in the market decision making process. Countries where that had previously been the case were observed to achieve a higher level of mutual understanding of different stakeholders, and thereby produced greater value-added.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

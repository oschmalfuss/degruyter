The first person to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, he wrote and directed some of the most bizarre, controversial and downright hilarious comedies of the 1940s, including Sullivan’s Travels and Hail the Conquering Hero. He may be the most talented Hollywood filmmaker yet to receive the critical recognition he deserves.The Films of Preston Sturges is a pioneering collection of essays by world-famous scholars that chart Sturges’ contributions to Hollywood cinema, revealing his pivotal status as an early writer-director, exploring his inimitable style and making a bold case for his ongoing influence today. Reawakening interest in this filmmaker’s life and works, this book will remind readers why Sturges’ movies remain not only immensely enjoyable, but of great cultural significance as well.Key featuresTraces Sturges’ early career and writing process, including the shift from playwright to writer-director as well as screenwriting techniquesProvides cultural contexts for Sturges’ films, including representations of class, gender and race Assesses the rises and falls of Sturges’ critical reputation and popularity, including his influence on contemporary filmmakersContributorsChristopher Beach teaches film in the English Department of Williams College.Matthew H.

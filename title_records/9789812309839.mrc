In Southeast Asia, water resources have been strained by the greater demand from different sectors such as agriculture, industry and domestic users. This situation is only likely to worsen in the future if active measures are not taken now. Is there a standard framework that can be adopted to promote cooperation in the use of water among countries? Could clearer institutions in river basins provide the backdrop for a more effective water management strategy in Southeast Asia? Does private sector involvement or privatization resolve some of the "public good" woes of water management? How does a sense of security and ownership enhance sustainability measures in a country? How have civil groups been able to promote effective water management in a country? How have water shortages been overcome in a predominantly urban city state? How have water pollution problems been resolved? Is there a potential for water conflicts in the years to come? What are some of the issues involved in sustainable watershed management? This publication draws from regional and country studies of the Mekong Basin, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines to understand the political and socio-economic dynamics involved in water management. It is a must read for anyone interested in water management issues in the region, understanding the past and present and also looking to future trends.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

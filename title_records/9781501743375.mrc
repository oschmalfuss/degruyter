John Sitter's book is a literary history of the 1740s and 1750s, a time of great experimentation and innovation, and a time to which the origins of many of the literary criteria of the current day can be traced.Studying the poetry, fiction, and nonfiction of the mid-eighteenth century, Sitter attempts to characterize the authors' shared pursuits and preoccupations. He focuses on what he calls literary loneliness—the emerging concept of the isolated writer who creates for a solitary reader, a writer who strives for a "pure poetry" unconnected to political and historical particulars. Tracing the literary changes that took place during the period, Sitter studies the early works of David Hume and the increasingly visionary writings of William Law; he considers the profound and puzzling break with the past manifested in contemporary poetry; and he analyzes the similar artistic premises and authorial difficulties apparent in the longer poems of Thomson, Young, and Akenside, and in the last novels of Richardson and Fielding. Their literary assumptions are still part of our critical tradition, Sitter says, and in his conclusion he notes some significant correspondences between mid-eighteenth- century literature and twentieth-century criticism.Anyone who studies the literature or the intellectual history of the eighteenth century, or who is concerned with the theory of literary history, will find Literary Loneliness rewarding reading.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

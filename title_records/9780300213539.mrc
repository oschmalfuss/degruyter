From a friend or relative who has impaired hearing? From an experienced audiologist? Both, says the author of this essential book!   In an unusual new approach, audiologist John M. Burkey offers not only specific and up-to-date information based on his own extensive experience with patients, but also useful, first-hand advice from those patients themselves. The Hearing-Loss Guide presents clear, basic facts on hearing impairment and treatments, followed by candid personal recommendations from people who are coping successfully with hearing difficulties. For anyone confronting hearing loss, for family members and friends, and for others who work alongside or care for a person with a hearing impairment, this book is a must-read.   Inside The Hearing-Loss Guide:    ·     Specific practical advice from patients and family members for coping with hearing loss  ·     A professional audiologist's clear explanations of hearing loss, current treatments, hearing aids, and other devices  ·     Helpful suggestions for friends, co-workers, and caretakers of persons with hearing difficulties       aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

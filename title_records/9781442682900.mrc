In this book, Wayne Warry argues that self-government can be realized only when individuals are secure in their cultural identity and can contribute to the transformation of their communities.Warry draws on his research among Anishnawbe communities, as well as on the reports and recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. Case studies are used to illustrate the processes of community development and cultural revitalization that are essential precursors to self-government. Warry's notion of 'community healing' involves efforts to rebuild the human foundations for self-governing Aboriginal societies. The book analyses key areas such as health care and the judicial and political systems where Aboriginal peoples are engaged in practical, everyday struggles to improve their communities. Central to these Aboriginal approaches to change is the need for holistic solutions to complex social problems. The search for these solutions is set against the broader political environment, which includes Euro-Canadian assumptions, government policy, and post-colonial practices. The book also addresses the nature of applied social scientific research in Aboriginal communities and the need for collaborative, culturally appropriate research methods.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

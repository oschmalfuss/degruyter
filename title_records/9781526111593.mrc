It investigates how the flow of information was managed and suppressed at the centre, as well as how James I attempted to mislead a variety of audiences about his policies and intentions. It also examines the reception and unintended consequences of his behaviour, and explores the political significance of the mis- and dis-information that circulated in court and country. It thereby contributes to a wider range of historical debates that reach across the politics and political culture of the reign and beyond, advancing new arguments about censorship, counsel and the formation of policy; propaganda and royal image-making; political rumours and the relationship between elite and popular politics, as well as shedding new light on the nature and success of James I’s style of rule.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

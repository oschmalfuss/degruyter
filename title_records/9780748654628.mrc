There are many books which deal with particular elements and individual photographers, which show the interest in the subject, but no book draws everything together to provide an understanding of the multi-faceted nature of photography and the inter-relationship with other activities in the society of the time. This authoritative introduction, building upon these other publications, will provide a wide-ranging appreciation of early Scottish photography and in particular that Scottish photography was in the vanguard of many international trends. The material has been structured and the topics organised, with appropriate illustrations, as both a readable narrative and a foundation text for the subject. Key Features Draws together a coherent narrative of the many different aspects of photography in Victorian ScotlandShows how photography was related to, and was influenced by, the society and culture of the timeHighlights how Scotland and Scots were in the forefront of photography in Victorian timesUses the most apt illustrations to emphasise the quality of the image-making Includes 130 illustrations  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

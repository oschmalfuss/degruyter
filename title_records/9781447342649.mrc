While this challenging activity places considerable demands at both practice and policy levels, when done well, service users agree it offers enhanced service provision. When delivered ineffectively, it can be frustrating and disempowering. This stimulating introductory text explores the challenges and opportunities for social-work education and practice within the context of multi-agency working. It brings together leading experts from across a range of disciplines, including criminology, mental health, child protection, drugs and alcohol, and education, to give the reader insights into different social care settings. It includes perspectives of those using services as well as describing the relevant legal and policy context and offering an overview of key research findings and contains trigger questions and a recommended resources section within each chapter. With an emphasis on identifying learning that can inform future practice, this text will be an essential text for both qualifying and post qualifying social workers who will go on to practice in diverse and assorted settings.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

Against this background, this is the first UK introductory textbook on direct payments and personal budgets, summarising the current evidence and implications for policy and practice. Designed for front-line practitioners and for student social workers, the book places these policies in context, explores their origins and impacts, and sets out the challenges and opportunities for practice. Written by leading national experts in the personalisation agenda, the book is essential reading for everyone involved in social care. This is a revised and updated second edition of the ground-breaking Social work and direct payments (The Policy Press, 2000).  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

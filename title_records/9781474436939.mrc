In the past, the debate centered on whether the shore was owned by the Crown or by adjacent proprietors and on how, and by whom, Crown-owned foreshore should be managed. Scotland’s Foreshore tells the story of the battle that took place during the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century between the Crown and private proprietors over the ownership of the foreshore. Drawing on his expert knowledge of law and its evolution, MacAskill provides new and valuable insights into the foreshore controversy and the contest between proprietors and the Crown and he discusses the important issues as to the management of the foreshore, issues that culminated in responsibility for the management of Scotland’s Crown-owned foreshore being devolved to the Scottish Parliament at a time when the question of land ownership is central to Scottish political debate.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

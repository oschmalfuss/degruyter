Can it oppose abuses of fantasy and power, and resist the attractions of violence? Can it make adequate provision for its own future? Who stands to gain from postmodernity?Cristopher Nash sets out these questions and more, taking the view that the entire body of writing on postmodernity needs to be reread in the light of the unique psychological character and motives that now appear to mould and drive it. Challenging our habit of confusing the vast vigorous culture of postmodernity with theories of 'postmodernism', he argues for a new way of seeing things. Instead of looking at the world through the filter of philosophical abstraction, The Unravelling of the Postmodern Mind is expressly and radically about affect. About what it feels like to (want to) be postmodern.Casting a wide net - beginning with a radical reading of the felt human needs fulfilled by philosophical indeterminist and pluralist thinking, and tracking similar impulses through the media, literature, fashion, the arts and architecture, tourism, dance and rock, drug culture, the cultures of cyberspace, virtual reality and cyberorganics, and the proliferation of new modes of birth, lifestyle and death - it catches the sound of the postmodern phenomenon in its greater clamour.This unique and controversial book shows that the postmodern does offer many of the things it claims for itself. That it presents problems about which it must keep silent. That it is, in elemental ways, a matter of choice. And that we have choices to make.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

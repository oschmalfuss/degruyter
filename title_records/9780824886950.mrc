If only it were possible to avoid those pesky, seemingly ubiquitous pollens, mold spores, and all those other troublemakers! to move in comfort from mountain to seashore, from cathedral to classical ruins!Here is a book designed to help the traveler do just that. Allergy in the World is a convenient guide, for physician and layman, telling which allergens to expect where—and when—for some fifty countries and areas around the world. Included are lists of airborne allergens and allergenic plants, pollen and mold calendars, summaries of important climatic and geographic features, and, in some cases, brief discussions of local clinical problems.The information, contributed by allergists from all over the world, is organized in a clear, uniform fashion to make its use as simple as possible. Thus the traveler seeking practical guidance, and particularly the physician advising allergenic patients, will find this a convenient source of pertinent information.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

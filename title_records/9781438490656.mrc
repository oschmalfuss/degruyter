Taylor distinguished himself as a spokesperson for progressive education and educational experimentation during the 1950s and would emerge in the 1960s as one of the country's leading public intellectuals and campus speakers, addressing issues related to student activism, peace education, and international studies. Written with insight and wit and carefully edited and reconstructed, Harold Taylor and Sarah Lawrence College will inspire college students, professors, and administrators to reconsider the most fundamental purposes of higher education and social and educational change.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

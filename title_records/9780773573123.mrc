Feminist studies of nationalism also envision women as either victimized by patriarchy within nationalist movements or as adopting masculine qualities to conform to the culture of their male compatriots. Jacoby takes an alternative approach, considering how women are situated across the political spectrum. She argues that when categories other than gender - such as class, ethnicity, religion, and political perspective - are considered, there is no single perspective on what it means to be a woman in conflict.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Through a series of close readings of poetry and prose, Unified Fields demonstrates that formal structures in literature can relate to scientific concepts through their essential interpretive functions. Janine Rogers engages with a wide range of writing from Canadian, British, and American authors, including the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop and Robyn Sarah as well as prose by Margaret Atwood, Ian McEwan, and Stephen Hawking. She employs an interdisciplinary approach combining formalist, historical, and theoretical literary practice, informed by interpretive frameworks developed in the philosophy of science. Although dedicated to contemporary texts, Rogers's analysis is frequently rooted in historical contexts of form, including Euclidean geometry and medieval romance, developed when the distinction between literature and science was not so drastic. These historical connections demonstrate that continuities of form resonate in both contemporary literature and science. Through critical analysis and engaging prose, Unified Fields bridges an important disciplinary gap by revealing how literary practice informs scientific understanding.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

Why has India been excluded from the history of philosophy? Richard King provides an introduction to the main schools of Hindu and Buddhist thought, emphasising the living history of interaction and debate between the various traditions. The book outlines the broad spectrum of Indian philosophical schools and questions prevailing assumptions about the 'mythical' ahistorical and 'theological' nature of Indian thought. Central philosophical questions are addressed: what really exists? How do we know what we know? Can we trust our perceptions of reality? What are we and where do we come from? Early chapters discuss the nature of philosophy in general, examning the shifting usage of the term throughout history. The author argues that a single definition or characterisation of the subject matter is impossible and that histories of philosophy remain tied to an ethnocentric and colonial perspective so long as they ignore the possibility of philosophical thought 'East of the Suez'. This highlights the need for a post-colonial and global approach to philosophy.Key FeaturesThematic approach rather than separate chapters on various schoolsEmphasis on history of interaction/debate between the various trendsIntroductory and concluding chapters on exclusion of 'India' from history of philosophy  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

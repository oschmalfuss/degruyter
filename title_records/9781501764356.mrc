This examination of the means and ends of China's quest for techno-security supremacy is required reading for anyone looking for clues as to the long-term direction of the global order.  The techno-security domain, Cheung argues, is where national security, innovation, and economic development converge, and it has become the center of power and prosperity in the 21st Century. China's paramount leader Xi Jinping recognizes that effectively harnessing the complex interaction between security, innovation, and development is essential in enabling China to compete for global dominance.  Cheung offers a richly detailed account of how China is building a potent techno-security state. The book takes readers from the strategic vision guiding this transformation to the nuts-and-bolts of policy implementation. The state-led top-down mobilizational model that China is pursuing has been a winning formula so far, but the sternest test is ahead as China begins to compete head-to-head with the US and aims to surpass its arch-rival by mid-century if not sooner.  Innovate to Dominate is a timely and analytically rigorous examination of the key strategies guiding China's transformation of its capabilities in the national, technological, military, and security spheres and how this is taking place. The book authoritatively addresses a burning question being asked in capitals around the world: Can and, if so, when will China become the dominant global techno-security power?  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

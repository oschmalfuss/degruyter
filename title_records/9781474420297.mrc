But why have his contributions to contemporary political theory commanded such attention? This book brings to life the ideas of a unique thinker, an heir to the Enlightenment legacy, a champion of reason and democracy, a social theorist of unusual sophistication and an astute commentator on contemporary politics. Unified by a central focus on the theme of power, the book guides you through the sociological and philosophical perspectives that are essential to Habermas’s political theory. It situates the philosopher’s political thinking in relation to key Continental theorists such as Carl Schmitt and Michel Foucault as well as current debates in Anglo-American political philosophy.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

Moreover, they demonstrate that the central objective of the People's movement was not simply to enhance American political democracy: it was also fuelled by a determination to avoid taxation of personalty (personal property or estate), which quickly won the support of canny and well-heeled backers both in upstate New York and in New York City. The authors draw on extensive research on New York's political life, from the town and county level to the state Assembly and Senate, and include profiles of the groups who were active in state politics in the early nineteenth century.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

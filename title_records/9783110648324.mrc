Bulgarian capital market is a part of the SEE group countries and it is a developing country and in the process of its development, people and investors should learn more about risk, credit risk management, and their relation to the rules of the listed companies and agencies. Many factors may provoke a change in stock prices: financial and monetary policies, macroeconomic conditions, investors’ expectations and country’s sovereign credit risk. Accepting sovereign CDS spreads as measurements of investment expectations regarding the development of Bulgarian capital market, we review the role of accounting information in CDS pricing because the accounting data may help investors make the most effective decision. The aim will be accomplished by creating an empirical model, based on the theoretical ones, including a panel data approach, several accounting variables, which are expected to have an impact on CDS spreads.n this research, we analyze the joint movement of eleven financial markets of South East Europe (SEE) - Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkey, Romania, Montenegro, Macedonia, Banja Luka and Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina) using correlation and regression analysis during the period 2005-2015. We reveal the role of investors’ expectations on the capital markets dynamics and sovereign credit risk in Bulgaria.

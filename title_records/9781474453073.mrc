During the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama the traditional safeguards and stabilizers to strategic competition were broadly adhered to, albeit in some cases not without great difficulty. Under the leadership of Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping, however, these bulwarks have alarmingly diminished. Abrupt departures in engagement platforms and asserting regional defensive postures have become the new norms. With brevity and nuance, this book provides much needed connective tissue in examining these departures and their antecedents across the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations. It reveals Washington and Beijing are moving towards a new period where, unlike previous ones, this one will be characterised by an amplified preponderance of competition, and the enhanced probability of conflict and confrontation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

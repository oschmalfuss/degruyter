He traces its history from the roots, when soldiers, settlers, and militia volunteers rallied to defend the southern borders of their adopted country against invasion from the United States. Drawing on diaries, letters, classified documents, and the regimental archive, Jarymowycz weaves the strands of a complex story into an epic narrative of a resolute collective of officers and men.Since its birth in 1862 as the 5th Battalion, Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada, thousands of citizens have served in the unit. In addition to securing Canada’s borders, Black Watch soldiers have fought in the South African War, both world wars, and the Korean War. They have bolstered NATO operations and United Nations peacekeeping missions, and they provided aid to the civil power during the 1997 Quebec and Eastern Ontario ice storm disaster and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Montreal-based battalion continues to serve Canada in its traditional role as a reserve infantry unit, and to this day, Black Watch soldiers frequently deploy on dangerous missions abroad. In volume 1, readers will learn of the Black Watch’s origins; its first foreign enterprise, the South African War; and a detailed account of the Great War, where the regiment evolved from the 5th Royal Highlanders to become the Canadian Black Watch, as they were known throughout the empire. The Montreal regiment trained four battalions for overseas duty, three of which participated in the greatest battles of the First World War, an unprecedented accomplishment. This volume not only offers a critical analysis of campaigns, key actions, and tactical evolution, but also includes an intimate and compelling account of the sacrifices that forged this extraordinary regiment.This monumental history of Canada’s oldest Highland regiment is at once a record of Scottish heritage, a portrait of Montreal rising as an industrial giant, and an examination of the emergence of a military culture from the Western Front.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

This new edition is an appraisal of that which is still thought to be valid, but with a significant updating in the light of new research. The structure of the book has been slightly changed to better reflect, not only current thinking, but the nature of existing texts and the greater degree of specialisation that now exists in the tourism literature. The book is primarily concerned with the determinants of tourism demand, the implications of that demand, and the problems posed for those who, in whatever capacity, seek to manage tourism at the destination level. After a new chapter that presents a history of tourism where the discerning reader can see that which is old and that which is new, the rest of the book analyses social, economic and psychological determinants of demand and discusses the broad aspects of destination change and the challenges presented to those responsible for managing such change. The book represents a learned introduction to the subject, a review of the developing literature and thinking that can be classified as broadly postpositivistic. In a curious manner it represents a return to the conventional, but within a new awareness of competing interpretations of one of the leading economic drivers of the new millennium.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

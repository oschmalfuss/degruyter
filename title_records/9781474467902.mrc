They are expected to put up with unnecessary risk and a lower quality of life. Groups who attempt to speak up in defence of their communities are often marginalised by government, industry and regulatory bodies. They find themselves branded as 'troublemakers'.This book, a unique insight into the nature of environmental campaigning in Scotland, draws on international as well as Scottish case studies and covers:The failure to make the polluter pay.Community attitudes to risk and loss of trust in scientists.The response of companies and authorities to challenge.Conflicts over jobs versus the environment.Troublemakers advocates a new perspective on Scotland's environment and urges us to move towards environmental justice for all.Key FeaturesAuthor is a prominent environmentalist - former Chief Executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland and previous Chairman of FoE International-Polemical - argues for a new perspective which will create environmental justice for all-Uses case studies of environmental campaigns to illustrate key points-Defends the role of troublemakers as catalysts for real challenge to authorities and bringing about change-Puts Scotland into international context, comparing its environmental record with the rest of the UK, Europe and the US-"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Escobar explores the proposition that the notion of intensity has the potential to change the way in which we think about Deleuze’s classification of films as signifying two separate periods, the classical period of the movement-image and the modern period of the time-image, thereby bringing them together and overcoming the separation that the philosopher creates. This book also explores the ways in which the intensive-image varies and differentiates itself from other images and the role it plays in contemporary cinema."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

Indeed it is the first attempt at a comprehensive treatment of the subject since W.D. Alexander published his concise Short Synopsis of the Most Essential Points in Hawaiian Grammar in 1864. This grammar is intended as a companion to the Hawaiian Dictionary, by the same authors.The grammar was written with every student of the Hawaiian language in mind - from the casual interested layperson to the professional linguist and grammarian. Although it was obviously impossible to avoid technical terms, their use was kept to a minimum, and a glossary is included for those who need its help. Each point of grammar is illustrated with examples, many from Hawaiian-language literature.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

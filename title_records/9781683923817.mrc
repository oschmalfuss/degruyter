Unlike many AutoCAD competitors, it uses both metric and imperial units to illustrate the myriad tools for this popular application. Use the companion disc to set up drawing exercises and projects and see all of the book’s figures in color (files are also available for downloading from the publisher by writing to info@merclearning.com).AutoCAD 2020 3D Modeling includes 50 “mini-workshops,” that complete small projects from concept through actual plotting. Solving all of the workshops will simulate the creation of full projects (architectural and mechanical) from beginning to end, without overlooking any of the basic commands and functions in AutoCAD 2020. Features: • Covers 3D solid modeling, 3D surface modeling, working with cameras/lighting, rendering and imaging, dimensioning and drafting, and model interchange• Includes 50 “mini-workshops,” that complete small projects from concept through actual plotting. Solving all of the workshops will simulate the creation of full projects (architectural and mechanical)• Provides new and seasoned users with step-by-step procedures on creating and modifying 3D models in both metric and imperial units• Companion disc can be used to set up in-text drawing exercises and projects and to see the book’s figures in color (files are also available for downloading from the publisher by writing to info@merclearning.com) • Written by an AutoDesk® Approved Instructor and Certified AutoDesk AutoCAD Master.  aIssued also in print.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 07.

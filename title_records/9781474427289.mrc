Based on extensive archival research involving more than thirty parishes, it sheds new light on the practice of poor relief in the century following the Reformation.John McCallum challenges the assumption that charitable activity was weak and informal in Scotland by uncovering the surviving records of welfare work carried out by the church. And he skilfully demonstrates that kirk sessions were key welfare providers in early modern Scotland and provided effective relief to a range of people who struggled in poverty. In addition to the analysis of specific parish activities, readers gain a rare insight into the lives of the poor Scots who looked to the church for assistance in the early modern era.Key FeaturesChallenges conventional interpretations which stress secularisation in the development of welfareThe first analysis of the practice of poor relief and experiences of poverty in pre-modern ScotlandBased on extensive archival research involving over thirty Scottish parishesProvides a new interpretation of the nature and effectiveness of pre-modern welfare provisionExtends Scottish Reformation studies into new territory by considering charity for the first time  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

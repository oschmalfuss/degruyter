Among the findings: philosophical-theological and textual approaches to the study of religion predominate, to the relative neglect of methodologies employed in fields such as sociology and anthropology; the quality and quantity of published research is significant but focusses on Christian studies; some interdisciplinary study is being carried on and benefits religious studies as well as other fields; religious studies scholars in Alberta have a relatively high public profile, but their exercise of public responsibility is time consuming and can jeopardize career advancement; in view of wide-spread religious illiteracy among students, descriptive courses must not be neglected in favour of analytical ones. An appendix listing courses offered in the schools surveyed concludes the volume.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

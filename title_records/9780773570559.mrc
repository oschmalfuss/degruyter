Greg Donaghy challenges the prevailing view that relations during this turbulent decade were primarily marked by mutual hostility, the product of growing Canadian nationalism and differences over the war in Vietnam. Instead Donaghy argues that through the Autopact and the GATT, Canada and the United States crafted a new economic partnership that tied the two countries together more tightly than ever before.Donaghy shows that economic integration was offset to some extent by diverging views on Western political and military strategy. As Pearson's government pursued distinct foreign and defence policies, American policy-makers acknowledged that Canadian objectives legitimately differed from their own and adjusted their policies accordingly. For its part, Ottawa rarely moved without weighing the impact its initiatives might have on Washington. As a result, Canada and the United States found ways to accommodate each other's interests without seriously impairing bilateral cooperation.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

The result is a new and expanded chronicle of the Scottish Panamanian initiative. It broadens what we know about the Company of Scotland beyond British history and into its rightful place in the saga of the multinational, tumultuous seventeenth-century Atlantic world.Julie Orr offers an in-depth analysis of the complex sociopolitics into which the Scots recklessly inserted themselves through their choice of Darien for settlement. Entanglement with slave-trading interests; the trial of five expedition participants in Spain; the dispatch of Admiral Benbow to the Caribbean with offers of assistance to Spanish governors; the activities of the Scottish spy Walter Herries; and the unintended diaspora of deserters, prisoners and survivors – all are afforded their rightful place in the story of Scotland’s attempt to establish a trading colony on the isthmus of Panama.Key FeaturesAnalyses the international complicity to undermine the establishment of New CaledoniaPresents the complex, tumultuous sociopolitics into which the Scots recklessly inserted themselves through their choice of Darien as the site of their settlementTells the story of the 1700 trial in Seville of 5 Darien survivorsInvestigates deserters, prisoners and survivors in the creation of an unintended diaspora  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

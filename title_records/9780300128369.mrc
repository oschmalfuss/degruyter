Kernberg reviews some of the recent developments and controversies in psychoanalytic theory and technique.Gathering together both previously published articles and extensive new material, Dr. Kernberg examines such issues as the new psychoanalytic views of homosexuality, bisexuality, and the influence of gender in the analytic relationship. He explores the application of psychoanalysis to non-clinical fields, including the problem of psychoanalytic research and its clinical implications, the validation of psychoanalytic interventions in the clinical process, and the challenges of psychoanalytic education. He shows how psychoanalysis can be helpful in addressing such cultural problems as socially sanctioned violence. And he asserts the continued relevance of object relations theory and its compatibility with Freud's dual drive theory.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

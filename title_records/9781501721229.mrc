Challenging the terms that have shaped the last 20 years of culture wars, the essays in Cultural Studies and Political Theory reject the accusations of the right that everything is political and of the left that politics is everything. They respond with an alternative, with an exploration of processes of politicization and culturalization that asks, "what does it mean for something to be political?"In affirming that there are different answers to this question, the contributors to Cultural Studies and Political Theory expand definitions of politics in light of transformations in globally networked, consumer-driven, mediated technoculture. Comprehending the production of the political is crucial at a time when the political and the cultural can no longer be decoupled and when we cannot know in advance who "we" are. By gathering the work of theorists who are redefining approaches to politics and culture, Jodi Dean establishes a set of directives for theoretical work at a new crossroads.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

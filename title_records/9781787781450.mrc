Ideal for information security managers, auditors, consultants and organisations preparing for ISO 27001 certification, this book will help readers understand the requirements of an ISMS (information security management system) based on ISO 27001. Similarly, for anyone involved in internal or external audits, the book includes the definitive requirements that auditors must address when certifying organisations to ISO 27001. The book covers: Implementation guidance – what needs to be considered to fulﬁl the requirements of the controls from ISO/IEC 27001, Annex A. This guidance is aligned with ISO/IEC 27002, which gives advice on implementing the controls;  Auditing guidance – what should be checked, and how, when examining the ISO/IEC 27001 controls to ensure that the implementation covers the ISMS control requirements.  The implementation guidance gives clear descriptions covering what needs to be considered to achieve compliance against the requirements, with examples given throughout. The auditing guidance covers what evidence an auditor should look for in order to satisfy themselves that the requirement has been met. Useful for internal auditors and consultants, the auditing guidance will also be useful for information security managers and lead implementers as a means of confirming that their implementation and evidence to support it will be sufficient to pass an audit. This guide is intended to be used by those involved in: Designing, implementing and/or maintaining an ISMS; Preparing for ISMS audits and assessments; or Undertaking both internal and third-party ISMS audits and assessments About the author Bridget Kenyon (CISSP) is global CISO for Thales eSecurity. Her experience in information security started in 2000 with a role in network vulnerabilities at DERA, following which she has been a PCI Qualified Security Assessor, information security officer for Warwick University and head of information security for UCL, and has held a variety of roles in consultancy and academia.

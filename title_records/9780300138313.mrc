The book and the dream are the poet's primary objects of investigation here. Through deft, quietly authoritative lyrics, Fisher meditates on the problems and possibilities-the frail craft-of perception for the reader, the dreamer, maintaining that "if the eye can love-and it can, it does-then I held you and was held." In her foreword to the book, Louise Glück writes that Fisher's poetry is "haunting, elusive, luminous, its greatest mystery how plain-spoken it is. Sensory impressions, which usually serve as emblems of or connections to emotion, seem suddenly in this work a language of mind, their function neither metonymic nor dramatic. They are like the dye with which a scientist injects his specimen, to track some response or behavior. Fisher uses the sense this way, to observe how being is converted into thinking."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

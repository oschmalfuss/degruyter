Best known for his published writings on epistemology and moral theory, he was also an accomplished mathematician and natural philosopher, as an earlier volume of his manuscripts edited by Paul Wood for the Edinburgh Reid Edition, Thomas Reid on the Animate Creation, has shown.The Correspondence of Thomas Reid collects together all of the known letters to and from Reid in a fully annotated form. Letters already published by Sir William Hamilton and others have been re-edited, and roughly half of the letters included appear in print for the first time.The letters illuminate virtually every aspect of Reid's life and career, and, in some instances, provide us with invaluable evidence about activities otherwise undocumented in his manuscripts or published works. Through his correspondence we can trace his relations with contemporaries like David Hume and his colleagues at both King's College, Aberdeen, and the University of Glasgow, as well as his engagement with the most controversial philosophical, scientific and political issues of his day. The letters assembled here serve as the starting point for understanding Reid and his place in the Enlightenment.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

In the first major study of the English poetic epitaph, Joshua Scodel examines the genre's once vital role in the social construction of the dead, arguing that the poetic epitaph's changing representations of the deceased are inseparable from changing relations among the living. Drawing upon genre theory, social and cultural history, and anthropology, Scodel situates the development of the genre from the seventeenth through the early nineteenth century within the central conflicts of English collective life.He shows how such writers as Jonson, Donne, Carew, Crashaw, Herrick, Marvell, Cowley, Dryden, Pope, Johnson, Gray, and Wordsworth transform generic conventions in order to create their individual epitaphic poetics.Readers interested in English literary history, cultural poetics, comparative literature, the history of attitudes toward death, and the relationship between literature and the visual arts will find The English Poetic Epitaph fascinating reading.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Scotland has a disproportionately high production of British output in many fields - technological, colonial, political, artistic and literary - and this book shows how Scotland, long used to the differences between nation and government, is leading the constitutional changes which are accompanying the break-up of the British union today. It condenses much of the pioneering research done on Scottish Studies over the last couple of decades, as well as introducing new research which helps link the field and make sense of this rapidly changing nation. Each chapter introduces an aspect of modern Scottish culture, including film, religion, sport, cultural history, mass media and literature.The first introduction to Scottish cultural studies, this book is aimed at undergraduates, 'A' Level students and the general reader interested in the culture of Scotland, and cultural studies as a whole.Key FeaturesThe first introduction to Scottish cultural studies, aimed at a wide audience of undergraduates, 'A' Level students and the general reader interested in the culture of Scotland, and cultural studies as a wholeAccessibly written, covering each period since the start of the eighteenth centuryEach chapter includes a summary, suggestions for further reading and questions for personal research."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

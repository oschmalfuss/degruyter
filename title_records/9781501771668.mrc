As told by Judy Hart, its visionary founder and first superintendent, the park's story is one of struggle and perseverance, opposition and solidarity. Hart narrates the uphill battle she fought to secure the park's location—on the site of the first women's rights convention in 1848—and to gain respect for the idea of a park dedicated to women's rights from 1978, when she first championed its creation to the triumphant moment in 1982 when the park opened its doors, and following years. Hart's journey highlights the prejudices and resistance that she faced, like other women who have advocated for themselves, their rights, and their place in America. Going behind the scenes of the park's planning and the negotiations, conflicts, and collaborations that shaped the final vision, A National Park for Women's Rights highlights the contributions of Park Service officials, politicians, and interested citizens in Seneca Falls, despite opposition from within and beyond the Park Service.An inspiration and rallying cry for women (and their male allies) to tell their stories and claim their place in American history, A National Park for Women's Rights also offers a model for public history activism. No matter how daunting the opposition to such acts of historical memory-making are, Hart's experiences remind citizen-activists to dream, organize, and persist.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

The father, James, is a recovering alcoholic seeking redemption, and the two daughters are struggling to overcome their differences-Sophie is an ardent born-again Christian, while Hiro lives a single's life in New York City. John, an old high school classmate of Hiro's who is now a single dad, worries about leaving a legacy for his son. Wry and bittersweet, God Said This vividly captures the complexities of a familial reconciliation in the throes of crisis and looks deeply at the meaning of family-Japanese, Southern, and otherwise. This is the first Yale Drama Series winner chosen by Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Ayad Akhtar, who describes the play as conveying "a deeply felt sense of the universal-of the perfection of our parents' flawed love for each other and for us; for the ways in which the approach of death can order the meaning of a human life."  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

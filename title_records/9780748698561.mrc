It examines Kipling's ambivalent relationship to the India of his childhood and the 'loss' of his mother figures. In doing so, it peels back the layers of masculine bravado that continues to characterize Kipling’s fiction to reveal a valorized ‘feminine’ space. From readings of the 1888 story 'Baa Baa, Black Sheep' through The Jungle Book and Stalky & Co., Kim, The Day's Work, Puck of Pook's Hill and Rewards and Fairies, Lizzy Welby demonstrates that Kipling created ways of rediscovering a symbolised feminine landscape as a restorative space, which was part of his 'psychic mapping'.Key Features:Demonstrates a steady development through Kipling’s long and extensive writing careerProvides insights into the man and his art as well as providing a new way of reading KiplingReferences a considerable range of scholarly and biographical work on Kipling, historical and cultural studies of nineteenth century India Offers close reading of passages from Kipling’s fiction, showing how a feminised landscape is violated by (masculine) technological developments"  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

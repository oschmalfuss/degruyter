Parenting Assessments in Child Welfare Cases seeks to clarify these procedures, offering a model that facilitates comprehensive assessments and useful and viable recommendations that benefit children.Perry Pezzot-Pearce and John Pearce guide practitioners through the steps of assessment, from negotiating the initial referral, through data collection and report writing to court testimony. They also alert assessors to practice issues they are likely to encounter as they approach these complex evaluations. Specific sections of the book address areas of concern to people who seek or use these assessments, such as when to make a referral and how to determine if the completed assessment is appropriate. This thorough, up-to-date guide will be essential reading for social workers, psychologists, members of the legal profession, family therapists, and others concerned with child welfare practice.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

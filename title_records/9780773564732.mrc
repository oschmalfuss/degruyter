These seven artists received most of the commissions awarded to women between 1958 and 1988, although until now their sizable body of work has been given little attention. Taking into account the purpose of public art - to enhance the environment and communicate with a public often perplexed and sometimes alienated by works of art - Gunda Lambton assesses the appeal and quality of commissioned works by these artists. She highlights the difficulties that many women artists encounter and combines detailed biographies of the artists with an examination of their work. This book will appeal to those interested in art as well as to art historians, urban historians, women's studies specialists, and policy makers.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

Written by a prominent divorce lawyer with four decades of experience, it is the most comprehensive treatment of the legal, emotion­al, economic, psychological, and social aspects of romantic relationships, marriage and divorce available anywhere in a single volume.Initial sections look at the dynamics of divorce: the causal factors, the common “stages” from initial separation onward, and the complications surrounding each stage for older and younger couples and children. Important information on spouse abuse is also included. The book dis­cusses key criteria in selecting an attorney and gives expert advice on directing and monitoring the course of a case efficiently and economical­ly. Detailed background on critical legal issues is given, followed by case histories highlighting key points of divorce law. Extensive new sec­tions have been added to this edition which provide key tips on preserving, improving, and possibly “saving” marriages. Key chapters focus on post-divorce issues of single parenthood and new relationships; as well as the rapidly changing nature of love, romance, “digital dating,” and other topics in this modern New Millennium.Informative yet highly readable (and occasionally amusing), Divorce with Decency has proven to be indispensable to anyone involved in a divorce, whether directly or indirectly.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

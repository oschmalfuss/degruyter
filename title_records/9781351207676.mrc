The papers from the Public Record Office and the National Archives in this collection were written between 1941 and 1947 for the most part by a small group of American and British naval intelligence officers, stationed at Bletchley Park, near London, and in Washington, D.C. and responsible for the production and dissemination of intelligence obtained from the interception and analysis of radio transmissions made to and from German U-boats. The documents have been selected with the objective of showing the functioning of the whole process of producing intelligence from obtaining, processing and analysing the raw material of communications intelligence including radio direction finding (D/F) bearings and decoded U-boat radio messages through to the production of the information necessary to fight and defeat the U-boats. They thus provide an 'insider's view' of the workings of communications intelligence during what became known as the Battle of the Atlantic.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

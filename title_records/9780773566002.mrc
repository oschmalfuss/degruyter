He contends that this dualistic belief affects not only our understanding of Canadian identity but also a host of fundamental concepts, including fraternity, justice, democracy, and federalism itself. LaSelva offers a compelling reconsideration of Confederation and of the pivotal role of George Étienne-Cartier, one of the fathers of Confederation, in both the achievement of confederation and the creation of a distinctively Canadian federalist theory. Given the current debates about Quebec sovereignty and Native self-government, the future of the Canadian federation is uncertain. The Moral Foundations of Canadian Federalism provides a timely and novel perspective in support of Canadian federalism.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

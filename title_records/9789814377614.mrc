Argues that personnel administration deserves high priority as "there is probably no more important single factor in successful administration than the securing of capable employees by the government". Items included in this study include Job Analysis and Classification, Salaries, Recruitment and Selection, Probation and Confirmation, Training, Transfers, Disciplinary Actions and Appeals, Promotion, Retirement, Pension and other Benefits and Relations with Employee Organizations. It lays bare to the reader the features of public personnel administration in Malaysia, including a brief background of the development of some of the features. Although the Malaysian system is a product of British colonialization, this paper shows that its contemporary fac has shown marked changes brought about by purely Malaysian inlfuences. It brings to the fore certain practices and techniques that other developing countries - in search of a relevant civil service system - could adopt.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Providing a clear narrative of the period, the book draws on a wide range of sources to examine the relationship between central power and the Scottish localities, and to provide a thematic analysis of political and religious developments. James VII was a radically experimental ruler, who granted unprecedented religious toleration and intervened systematically in urban government. Here the sovereign’s reign is examined in the context of British and European developments, and in the light of current historical debates.Key FeaturesThe fullest examination to date of a transformative period in Scotland’s pastAnalyses James VII’s reign in the context of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century political and religious changeProvides a clear narrative of the period, as well as thematic analysis of political and religious developmentsDraws on a wide range of sources, including the local records of the Church of Scotland and all surviving council minutes of the royal burghs  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

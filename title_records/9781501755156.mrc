In Rich Thanks to Racism, one of the country's leading civil rights lawyers, Jim Freeman, explains why as he reveals the hidden strategy behind systemic racism. He details how the driving force behind the public policies that continue to devastate communities of color across the US is a small group of ultra-wealthy individuals who profit mightily from racial inequality.In this groundbreaking examination of "strategic racism," Freeman carefully dissects the cruel and deeply harmful policies within the education, criminal justice, and immigration systems to discover their origins and why they persist. He uncovers billions of dollars in aligned investments by Bill Gates, Charles Koch, Mark Zuckerberg, and a handful of other billionaires that are dismantling public school systems across the US. He exposes how the greed of prominent US corporations and Wall Street banks were instrumental in creating the world's largest prison population and our most extreme anti-immigrant policies. He also demonstrates how these "racism profiteers" prevent these flagrant injustices from being addressed by pitting white communities against communities of color, obscuring the fact that the struggles faced by white people are deeply connected with those faced by people of color. Rich Thanks to Racism is an invaluable roadmap for all those who recognize that the key to unlocking America's full potential is for more people of all races and ethnicities to prioritize racial justice.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 31.

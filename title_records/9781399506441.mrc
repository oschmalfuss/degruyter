More recently, it experienced a modest electoral revival under the leadership of Ruth Davidson (2011-19). Yet while aspects of the party’s history have received attention from historians and political scientists, it remains relatively neglected, with most publications either out of print or out of date. Strikingly, there exists no up-to-date, accessible single-volume history of the party from its origins in the late nineteenth century until present.Furthermore, a lot of Scottish Conservative history is coloured by mythology and political prejudice. This volume, the second in a series of Scottish party histories, plugs this significant gap in the literature.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

"-Samuel Beckett, Waiting for GodotIn a venturesome study of corporeality and perception in contemporary drama, Stanton B. Garner, Jr., turns this awareness of the spectator's gaze back upon itself. His book takes up two of drama's most essential and elusive elements: spatiality, through which plays establish fields of visual and environmental relationship; and the human body, through which these fields are articulated. Within the spatial terms of theater, this book puts the body and its perceptual worlds back into performance theory.Garner's approach is phenomenological, emphasizing perception and experience in the theatrical environment. His discussion of the work of playwrights after 1950-including Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Peter Weiss, Harold Pinter, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Edward Bond, Maria Irene Fornes, Caryl Churchill, and Ntozake Shange-explores the body's modes of presence in contemporary drama. Drawing on work in areas as diverse as scenographic theory, medical phenomenology, contemporary linguistics, and feminist theories of the body, Garner addresses topics such as theatrical image, stage objects, dramatic language, the suffering body, and the staging of gender, all with a view toward developing a phenomenology of mise en scene.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 28.

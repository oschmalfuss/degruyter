From a childhood in an Indian residential school, to the defense of aboriginal rights before the World Court, to being disbarred, Bruce Clark's struggle has led him to a fight against the justice system itself. Justice in Paradise explains the legal and philosophical position behind Clark's opposition to the Indian rights industry. He argues that the North American legal system causes the genocide of those indigenous peoples who embrace traditional religion and identity and accuses those who administer it with chicanery and abandoning the rule of law. Smeared in the media for his beliefs and attacked from the bench - he has been called "a disgrace to the bar" by the Chief Justice of Canada's Supreme Court - his book Native Liberty, Crown Sovereignty has been hailed as "the most important and meticulous recent study of native rights in common law" (Canadian Journal of Political Science). Clark turned his back on a comfortable lawyer's life to defend the rule of law and Native rights. He moved with his family to Indian reservations and then to squats while he argued his case before the World Court in Europe. Now, no longer able to practice law, he has been adopted by the Mohicans and together they are fighting for Liberty Island and the Hudson River drainage basin. In his extraordinary memoir, Justice in Paradise, Bruce Clark - hero to some, extremist to others - details the battles of a renegade's life.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

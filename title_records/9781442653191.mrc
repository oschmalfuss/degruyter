Vanier, one of the most eminent public figures of Canada. His broad interests and deep involvement in all aspects of Canadian life are reflected in these speeches. A life-long concern with the importance of the family is evident in his opening talk at the Canadian Conference on the Family in 1964: ";.the best and surest way of developing generous and idealistic hearts, of giving the community men and women who are well-balanced and conscious of their responsibilities to their country, is to protect the family, for the family.is capable of giving to the universe the human beings who are prepared to put justice and truth before their own personal interests."; From this conference emerged the Vanier Institute of the Family.Closely allied to the Governor-General's dedication to the family was his interest in the youth of the country. During his time of office he strove continually to bring Canadians to a fuller realization of the importance of their young people: ";Tell me the character of a nation's young people and I will tell you the future of the nation.";The book also includes the core of the Governor General's statements on education, reflections that have special meaning for every teacher and educator in Canada. His views on public life and on the democratic ideal, and his great desire for better understanding between English and French Canadians and for the essential unity of the Canadian nation, also hold a place of prominence in these excerpts.The final section of the book is devoted to his intense concern for the spiritual side of man's existence, for the ideals and values that set man apart and allow him to hope for a better world.Dr Wilder Penfield, head of the Vanier Institute of the Family, who was a close friend of the Governor General, and Claude Ryan, editor of Le Devoir, have written forewords for the volume.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

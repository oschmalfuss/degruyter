Though we rarely see them at work, building inspectors have the power to significantly shape our lives through their discretionary decisions. The building inspectors of Chicago are at the heart of sociologist Robin Bartram’s analysis of how individuals affect—or attempt to affect—housing inequality. Using both ethnography and statistical analysis of the building inspectors who respond to complaints about housing conditions in Chicago, Bartram calls attention to the importance of these frontline workers and the power of their agency. In Stacked Decks, she reveals surprising patterns in the judgment calls inspectors make when deciding whom to cite for building code violations. These predominantly white, male inspectors largely recognize that they work within an unequal housing landscape that systematically disadvantages poor people and people of color through redlining, property taxes, and city spending that favor wealthy neighborhoods. While they often act out of a desire to bring justice to this uneven playing field by penalizing those perceived as advantaged, Stacked Decks illustrates the uphill battle inspectors face when trying to change a housing system that works against those with the fewest resources.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 29.

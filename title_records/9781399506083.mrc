Authoritarian regimes in places like China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are infamous for cracking down on domestic opposition movements and democracy activists at home. And, in our age of globalisation, migration and technological development, dictators are increasingly able to extend their authoritarian power over their critics abroad. Using tactics that include surveillance, coercion, harassment and physical violence, transnational repression threatens the lives of democracy defenders, the basic rights of diaspora members and the rule of law in host states.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 26.

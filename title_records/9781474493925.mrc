As the age of metaphysics comes to a close with the Nietzschean “death of God” crisis of nihilism, the emergence of film gives birth to a new absolute value, a secular re-enchantment of the world, or ‘the world in its own image’. Film radically transforms the metaphysical paradigm from rational speculation through concepts to mechanical revelation through images and sounds—a revelation vital to the capacity for the art of film to enlighten and enthrall.In this book, Mowchun discusses film theorists and philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, Stanley Cavell, Robert Bresson, and Heinrich von Kleist, in relation to films which possess a “metaphysical film style,” including The Thin Red Line and The Turin Horse. Painting and photography are also considered a precursor to the moving image, but it’s a specifically cinematic metaphysics which promises to lead us out of the traps of abstraction and alienation inadvertently set by old metaphysics. Mowchun demonstrates that in the aftermath of the ‘end of metaphysics’, questions about being, value and truth find compelling and open-ended responses in cinema.

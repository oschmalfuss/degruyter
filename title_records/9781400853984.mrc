In his study, he examines and transcribes the ways in which Ruskin observed his dislocation of imagination and shows how, in the very process of disintegration; he was enabled by his peculiar genius to transform the effects on his language and conceptualization into new forms of articulation under pain.Originally published in 1981.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

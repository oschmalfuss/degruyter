Scott, University of St. Andrews, Scotland “This book certainly will become the new standard account of the subject….The book’s many footnotes and its annotated bibliography provide a rich survey of research in the field. Specialists as well as students should profit from this work. Highly recommended for public and university libraries.”-Library Journal “The book appears to be designed for use by students but most historians will find it thought-provoking.”-Journal of the Early Republic “This will become the successor to Bemis’s The Diplomacy of the American Revolution for at least as many years as that work has been the standard. Dull’s writing is clear and often elegant, the positions are convincing, and the footnotes and bibliography are an important contribution in themselves.”-Lawrence Kaplan, Kent State University  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

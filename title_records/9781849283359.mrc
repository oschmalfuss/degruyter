The objective of the book is to raise awareness of the fact that the People’s Republic of China is using a combination of their unique culture, language, and political will, known as Chinese Communism, to maintain their cultural  heritage. This book is the first to gather the salient information regarding the use of cyber warfare doctrine by the People’s Republic of China to promote its own hegemonistic, national self-interests and enforce its political, military and economic will on other nation states. The threat of Chinese Cyberwarfare can no longer be ignored. It is a clear and present danger to the experienced and innocent alike and will be economically, societally and culturally changing and damaging for the nations that are targeted. This book should be read by many, from individuals through to governmental departments. Those that will find benefit from the book include, but are not limited to, law enforcement agencies, international information security professionals, IT professionals, military professionals, government policy makers and corporate management.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

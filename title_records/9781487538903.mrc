Even a global pandemic could not slow it down. The league generates more than $5 billion annually, its revenues and media deals continue to grow, and its properties are increasing in value, innovation, and quantity. More clubs are profitable than are not, and the game of hockey is expanding globally. Business the NHL Way draws on hockey-inspired stories to show how brands, institutions, and individuals associated with the NHL have consistently survived a variety of challenges and thrived as a result of its decisions. The book explores twelve business-related scenarios from the sport of hockey and links each lesson back to business, leadership, diversity, management, and sport outcomes. Using ice hockey as an analogy for life, Norm O’Reilly and Rick Burton – leaders in the business of sports and former amateur hockey players – inform business and industry professionals on best practices to achieve strategic outcomes and career advancement. The book aims to help businesses emerge from the financial and health disruptions of the global COVID-19 pandemic that not only altered the future of hockey but threatened business sustainability in every sector. Business the NHL Way will appeal to both casual and passionate hockey fans, as well as anyone eager to follow in the footsteps of a successful professional sports organization.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 03.

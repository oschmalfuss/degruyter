This timely book provides an easy-to-understand explanation of the issues as well as sensible proposals for a truly sustainable energy policy. Economist James Griffin points out that current energy policies are fatally flawed and that government policies should focus on “getting the prices right” so that the prices of fossil fuels reflect their true costs to society-including greenhouse gas and security costs. By using carbon and security taxes, alternative energy forms will be able to compete on a more even playing field against fossil fuels. This will unleash advances in alternative energy and conservation technologies enabling the marketplace and consumers to find the right balance among energy sources that are cheap, clean, and secure.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 24.

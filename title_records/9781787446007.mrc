An Anglican Evangelical, active in India and Persia, he translated the New Testament into Urdu and Persian, pioneeredengagement between Protestant Christianity and Islam, and inspired a generation of British and American evangelical missionary efforts. He is a central figure for the history of the East India Company and its relationship to themissionary movement. This book provides a fully annotated transcription of all Martyn's surviving 327 letters, together with a very substantial introduction covering Martyn's biography, missiology and churchmanship, circle of correspondents, philological contribution, and experience in India and Persia. The letters themselves are rich in detail about East India Company governance in India and the importance of the religious issue at the highest levels. Thebook will be of great interest to historians of India and the East India Company, historians of Anglo-Persian relations and of Evangelical Anglicanism and the broader Protestant missionary movement, and those interested in the emergence and shape of modern Christian-Islamic discourse. SCOTT D. AYLER spent 24 years as an English-language instructor in the Middle East and South Asia, most recently at the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. He completed his doctorate in History at the University of Wales, Lampeter.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

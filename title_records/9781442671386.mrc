The latter include women in socialist and labour movements, the farm and peace movements, and women active in various ethnic communities. Expanding the noton of politics, the authors highlight the widespread nature of women's activism - particularly at the local level - and challenge the easy formulation that women were primarily interested in the vote and lost interest in politics when they acquired it. Some of the essays suggest that even the suffrage campaign has been misrepresented as solely a middle-class movement.Women evolved their own styles of political participation shaped by local contexts, class, culture, family, and lifestyle. Women often organized at the community level, and worked both in combination with men and in women-only settings. Contributors to this volume explore women's involvement in organizations from the political left to right, and women's efforts to shape Canada's political priorities and activities. Politically minded women often found that the best outlet for commitment and service was through women's organizations, which addressed their needs and provided a base for effective action.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

Gissing wanted to be a cowboy. He travelled from Alberta to California and back on horseback, sketching and painting as he went. Examples of this early work appear in the book. Gissing began selling his work and supporting himself solely by painting. The author discusses Gissing's technique as his style began to change and how the artist's frame of mind was reflected in his work. There is a good representation of the work of this period in the book. The book concludes with a discussion of Gissing's love of steam locomotives and some details about his time spent building these scale trains. Finally a sampling of paintings of the drastically different seascapes and badlands he was doing in the few years before his death, concludes the pictorial record of Gissing's life and works.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 06.

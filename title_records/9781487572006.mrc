It is in these years that Disraeli is often held to have founded 'modern' Conservatism, by adapting the party to the necessity of broading the franchise and promoting the interests of the new working-class electors to the forefront of politics. Yet the party hardly became deeply imbued with 'Disraelian' ideas, and the vital current in its development seems to have been rather its growing understanding with the urban bourgeoisie than any raaprochement with the urban working classes. The book discusses the party's course of evolution in its Disraelian period by focusing on a central theme of 'Disraelian' Conservatism -- social reform. Dr Smith examines the role given to social reform in Conservative strategy, and the attitudes adopted by the party towards the social problems most important to the condition of the working classes, education, public health, housing, labour questions, the drink traffic, and poor relief. Finally, he gauges how far the party was affected by 'Disraelian' ideas of popular appeal on the basis of social improvement, and how far its outlook and character were being shaped in other moulds.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

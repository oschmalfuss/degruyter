Lord Jenkins also offers his views on the personalities of these men, recognizing that the character of leaders naturally shapes their leadership. Of William Ewart Gladstone, for example, Lord Jenkins notes that, while he was "not necessarily the greatest prime minister," Gladstone was "certainly the most remarkable specimen of humanity ever to inhabit 10 Downing Street." Gladstone climbed mountains at the age of seventy-five and read twenty thousand books in his lifetime. Herbert Henry Asquith and Winston Churchill were remarkably different in their oratory skills. While Asquith reveled in the pressure of spontaneous, emotional speeches to large crowds, Churchill excelled in a more literary, meticulous approach to his audience, which explains why the latter prime minister was so respected for his performances on radio broadcasts.Lord Jenkins' style, seasoned by the experience of having published over sixteen books on politics and politicians, reflects a keen sense of British history and politics and, more generally, of our fascination with the inner workings of political and personal lives. The British Liberal Tradition, by Lord Roy Jenkins, is the fourth annual Senator Keith Davey Lecture, delivered at Victoria University at the University of Toronto in 2000.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 30.

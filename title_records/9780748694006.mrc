Long reviled as four hundred years of unrelieved slavery and barbarity ('the Turkish yoke'), a new generation of scholars, based mainly but not exclusively in Greece, is rejecting this view in favour of a more nuanced picture of the Greek experience in the Ottoman Empire.This volume considers this new scholarship, most of it in Greek, and makes it accessible for the first time to a wider audience. Molly Greene also discusses the changing views of the Ottoman Empire more generally and assesses what this changing historiography can tell us about this period in Greek history. The book begins with the conventional date of 1453, the fall of Constantinople, and includes debates over the extent to which 1453 represented a real break with the past. The volume ends with the Russo-Ottoman War of 1768-1774, which brought to an end the relative peace and stability of the Ottoman eighteenth century and helped to usher in the nationalist movements in the region.Key features:Covers the period from the arrival of Evrenos Bey in Thessaly in 1400 through to 1770Depicts a Greek world that is very different, both from the well-known contours of Greek antiquity as well as from the modern nation-state of GreeceIncludes illustrations, maps, a timeline and a further reading sectionMajor Themes: the fate of the 1,000-year Byzantine heritagethe millet system and Ottoman societythe connections between the Greek population and other members of Ottoman societythe Greeks in a European context  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

Cross-cultural pragmatics involves the use of contrastive linguistic research, supported by a variety of methodologies such as surveys, interviews and discourse completion tests. A key strength of the speech act-centred interactional framework proposed is that it allows the reader to understand difficulties faced by foreign language learners through pragmatic evidence. An important advantage of this approach is that it consistently avoids ideological pre-assumptions and related overgeneralisations. The book presents the framework in a highly accessible and reader-friendly way and illustrates how to put this framework to use with a number of case studies. The authors are internationally leading experts of pragmatics and applied linguistics whose work is a must-read for both academics and students focusing on applied linguistics and second language learnings.  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

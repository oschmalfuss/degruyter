This book is the first full account of the history of twentieth-century Scottish education, by Lindsay Paterson, a leading specialist in the area.Scottish Education investigates Scotland's response to the key question faced by all mass systems of education. How can democracy be reconciled with the necessity of selection - both selection of culture in the maintenance of excellence, and selection of people, allocating them to differentiated occupations while also preparing them for life as equal citizens in the common culture of the community?Paterson argues that the Scottish answer to this has been recurrent attempts to give wide access to common types of educational institution, but continuing to define that education in fairly traditional academic terms. This is then also Scotland's attempt to reconcile the tension between social solidarity and liberal opportunity, between the needs of the individual and the needs of society and its inherited culture.This broad-ranging and stimulating account of a century of Scottish education is organised chronologically into two broad parts: Competition and Opportunity, 1880s-1930s; and Welfare and Individualism, 1940s-1990s. Within these periods are chapters on each of the main sectors of education.Key FeaturesScottish education often claimed to be a world-leader - the facts behind this are exploredWritten by one of the most prominent commentators in the areaTopical, in light of on-going controversy surrounding the Scottish Qualifications AuthorityProvides background history to the development of Scottish education through the 20th century  aMode of access: Internet via World Wide Web.  aIn English.0 aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (publisher's Web site, viewed 02.

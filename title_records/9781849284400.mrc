While ISO 19770-1 describes processes and activities for addressing effective software asset management, it does not offer guidance on how to approach the implementation of a SAM programme – this pocket guide fills the gap and shows you how to do it.  A guide to SAM concepts The pocket guide offers a concise summary of the principles of software asset management as conveyed by ISO 19770-1: 2012, and provides advice and guidance on how to kick-start your own SAM programme – something the Standard alone doesn’t offer. Chapter 1 discusses the reasons why SAM is necessary, such as preventing the use of unlicensed software and reducing the costs of licensed software. Other benefits, including improved disaster recovery (DR) and a better general understanding of software licensing, are also explained. Chapter 2 summarises the 27 processes and activities of the ISO 19770-1 framework for addressing the management of your software assets. Chapter 3 provides practical advice and guidance on how to approach your own SAM programme, and also introduces the concept of using Mind Maps® to keep abreast of your programme’s development and progress. Chapters 4 and 5 give some useful tips and tricks on writing your own SAM processes, and a final conclusion and summary of the next steps to take. Software asset management (SAM) has not always enjoyed the same level of attention as other more high-profile areas of IT management, such as information security, procurement and vendor relationship management. Its recent rise in status is primarily due to organisations seeking to address software vendor audits with information and data to counter what may appear (at least at face value) to be exorbitant demands for licence fees. However, regardless of where an organisation sits within the current economic climate, the management of software assets, and the cradle-to-the-grave costs involved in owning those assets, should never be ignored. Helping to address the aforementioned issues, ISO19770-1:2012 SAM Process Guidance: A kick-start to your SAM programme, is aimed at anyone looking to gain a better understanding of the concepts of software asset management and the resulting benefits it can bring to their business.
